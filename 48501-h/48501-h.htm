<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br/>
THE GREAT NEWS</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Every</span> Wednesday evening in winter Katy Gaumer
went to the Millerstown post-office for her grandfather&#39;s
&quot;Welt Bote,&quot; the German paper which
circulated among the Pennsylvania Germans of
Millerstown. By six o&#39;clock she and Grandfather
Gaumer and Grandmother Gaumer had had supper;
by half past six she had finished drying the dishes;
by half past seven she had learned her lessons for
the next day; and then, a scarlet shawl wrapped
about her, a scarlet &quot;nubia&quot; on her head, scarlet
mittens on her hands, Katy set forth into Millerstown&#39;s
safe darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes&mdash;oh, the thrill that closed her throat
and ran up and down her spine and set her heart to
throbbing and her eyes to dancing at sound of that
closed door!&mdash;sometimes it rained and she pushed
her way out into the storm as a viking might have
pushed his boat from the shore into an unfriendly
sea; sometimes it snowed and she lifted her hot face
so that she might feel the light, cold flakes against
her cheek; sometimes deep drifts lay already on the
ground and she flung herself upon them or into them;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
sometimes she danced back to say a second good-bye
so that she might enjoy her freedom once more;
sometimes she stole round under the tall pine trees
and knocked ponderously at the door, knowing perfectly
well that her grandmother and grandfather
would only smile at each other and not stir.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes she crossed the yard in snow to her
knees to rap against the kitchen window of Bevy
Schnepp, who kept house for Great-Uncle Gaumer,
the squire. Bevy&#39;s real name was Maria Snyder,
but Katy had renamed her for one of the mythical
characters of whom Millerstown held foolish discourse,
and the village had adopted the title. Bevy
was little and thin and a powerful worker. She was
cross with almost every one in the world, even with
Katy whom she adored and spoiled. There was a
tradition in Millerstown that she was once about
to be married, but that at the ceremony her spirit
rebelled. When the preacher asked her whether she
would obey, she cried out aloud, &quot;By my soul, no!&quot;
and the match was thereupon broken off. Bevy
adorned her speech with many proverbs, and she had
an abiding faith in pow-wowing, and also in spooks,
hexahemeron cats, and similar mysterious creatures.
She had named the squire&#39;s dog &quot;Whiskey&quot; so that
he could not be bewitched. She would as soon have
thrown her cabbage plants away as to have planted
them in any other planetary sign than that of the
Virgin. She belonged, strangely enough, to a newly
established religious sect in Millerstown, that of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
Improved New Mennonites, who had no relation
to the long-established worthy followers of Menno
Simons in other parts of the Pennsylvania German
section. It is difficult to understand how Bevy reconciled
her belief in the orthodox if sensational
preaching of the Reverend Mr. Hill with her use of
such superstitious rhymes as</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Dulix, ix, ux,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thou comest not over Pontio,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Pontio is over Pilato&quot;&mdash;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">to which she had recourse when trouble threatened.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes Katy untied &quot;Whiskey&quot; and they
scampered wildly, crazily away together. Katy did
everything in the same unthinking, impetuous way.
Both she and Whiskey were young, both were irresponsible,
both were petted, indulged, and entirely
care-free. Katy was the orphan child of her grandparents&#39;
Benjamin; it was not strange that they
could deny her nothing. Of her mother and father
she had no recollection; to her grandparents she
owed anything she might now be or might become.</p>

<p class="indent">To-night there was no snow upon the ground. The
stars shone crisply; in the west the young moon
was declining; though it was December, the season
seemed more like autumn than like winter. Millerstown
lay still and lovely under its leafless trees; not
in the quiet of perpetual drowsiness,&mdash;Millerstown
was stirring enough by day!&mdash;but in repose after
the day&#39;s labor and excitement. To the east of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
village the mountain rose somberly; to the south the
pike climbed a hill toward the church and the school-house;
to the west and north lay the wide fields. To
the north might be seen the dim bulk of the blast
furnace with the great starlike light of the bleeder
flame.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder what it looks like now from the top of
the mountain,&quot; soliloquized Katy. &quot;I would like
to climb once in the dark night to the Sheep Stable.
I wonder if it is any one in all Millerstown brave
enough to go along in the dark. I wonder what the
church looks like inside without any light. I wonder&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Awed by the quiet, Katy stood still under the
pine trees at the gate. She heard Whiskey whine to
be let loose; she heard Bevy open the door of the
squire&#39;s kitchen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy, Katy Gaumer! Come here once, Katy
Gaumer!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy did not answer. Bevy had probably a cake
for her or some molasses candy; she could just as well
put it in the putlock hole in the wall of grandfather&#39;s
house. A putlock hole is an aperture left by the removal
of a scaffolding. It is supposed to be filled in,
but either the builder of the old stone house had
overlooked one of the openings, or the stone placed
there had fallen out. It now made a fine hiding-place
for Katy&#39;s treasures.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy had at this moment no time to give to Bevy.
Her heart throbbed, her hands clutched the gate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
She did not know why she was always so thrilled and
excited when she was out alone at night.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is like Bethlehem,&quot; she whispered to herself,
as she looked down the street, then up at the sky.
&quot;The shepherds might be watching or the kings
might come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy opened the gate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I love Millerstown,&quot; she declared. &quot;I love Millerstown.
I love everybody and everything in
Millerstown.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The post-office was next to the store and on the
same street as Grandfather Gaumer&#39;s. There are
only three streets in the village, Main Street and
Locust and Church, and all the houses are built
out to the pavement in the Pennsylvania German
fashion, so that the little settlement does not cover
much ground. Perhaps that was why Katy, leaving
Main Street and starting forth on Locust, came so
soon to the end of her spasm of affection. There did
not seem to be enough of the village to warrant any
such fervent outpouring. At any rate, Katy&#39;s mood
changed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am tired of Millerstown,&quot; she declared with
equal fervor. &quot;It is dumb. It is quiet. Nothing
ever happens in this place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The residents of Locust Street were especially
dull to Katy&#39;s thinking. Dumb Coonie Schnable
lived here and dumb Ellie Schindler, and Essie Hill,
whom she hated. Essie was the daughter of the pastor
of the Improved New Mennonites, of whom Bevy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
Schnepp was one. The preacher himself was tall and
angular and rather blank of countenance, but Essie
was small and pretty and pink and smooth of speech
and by no means &quot;dumb.&quot; Once, being a follower
of her father&#39;s religious practices, Essie had risen in
school and had prayed for forgiveness for Katy&#39;s
outrageous impudence to the teacher, and had thereupon
become his favorite forever. That Essie could
really be what she seemed, that she could like to hear
her father shout about the Millerstown sinners, that
she could admire the silly, short-back sailor hat
adorned with a Bible verse, which was the head-covering
of the older female members of the Improved
New Mennonite Church&mdash;this Katy could not,
would not believe. Essie was a hypocrite.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes the Improved New Mennonites might
be heard singing or praying hysterically. Katy had
often watched them through the window, in company
with Ollie Kuhns and Billy Knerr and one or
two other naughty boys and girls, and had sometimes
helped a little with the hysterical shrieking.
To-night the little frame building was dark, and
here, as down on Main Street, there was not a sound.</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of Locust Street, Katy went through
a lane to Church Street, and there again she stood
perfectly still, her eyes gleaming, her ears listening,
listening, listening. On the mountain road above
her, she could see dimly a little white house, which
seemed to hug the hillside and to hold itself aloof
from Millerstown. Here lived old Koehler, who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
not really very old, but who was crazy and who was
supposed to have stolen the beautiful silver communion
service of Katy&#39;s church. The children used
to shout wildly at him, &quot;Bring it back! Bring it
back!&quot; and sometimes he ran after them. One sign
of his lunacy was his constant praying in all sorts of
queer places and at queer times that the communion
service might be returned, when all he needed for the
answering of his prayer was to seek the service where
he had hidden it and to put it back in its place. The
Millerstown children never carried their mocking
to his house, since they believed that he was able to
set upon them the swarms of bees that lived in hives
in his little garden, among which he went without
fear. They said among themselves&mdash;at least the
romantic girls said&mdash;that he did not give his son,
poor, handsome Alvin, enough to eat.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Katy&#39;s heart beat with a new thrill.
There was no instinct within her which was not
awake or wakening. Her cheeks flushed, her scarlet
mittens clasped each other. She liked handsome
Alvin because she liked him&mdash;no better reason was
given or required in Katy&#39;s feminine soul.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think Alvin is grand,&quot; exclaimed Katy to
herself. &quot;I am sorry for him. I think he is grand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a sound, and Katy started. Suppose
Alvin should come upon her suddenly! She went on
a few steps, then once more she stopped to listen.
Once more Millerstown was quiet, again she looked
and listened.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
Back in the shadows across the street stood a large,
fine house, the home of John Hartman, Millerstown&#39;s
richest man. There were in that house fine
carpets and beautiful furniture. But in spite of their
possessions the Hartmans were not a happy family.
Mrs. Hartman was handsome and she had beautiful
clothes and a sealskin coat to wear to church, but
she was disturbed if leaves drifted down on the grass
in her yard or if the coming of visitors made it necessary
to let the sunlight in on her thick carpets. Her
only child, David, was sullen and stupid and cross.
Remembering the delightful bass singing of one
Wenner in the church choir, Katy had run away from
home when a mere baby to visit the church on a
week day and from there John Hartman had driven
her home. Her grandmother to whom she had fled
had insisted that he had not been angry, but that he
had only sent her back sternly and properly where
she belonged. But the impression was not quite persuaded
away. Katy used to pretend in some of her
wild races that she was fleeing from John Hartman.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly there was another sound. Some Millerstonian
had opened a window or had closed a shutter
and Katy took to her heels. It amused her to pretend
once more that she was running away from John
Hartman. In a moment she had opened the door
of the village store and had flashed in.</p>

<p class="indent">Round the stove sat four men, old and middle-aged;
to the other three, Caleb Stemmel was holding
forth dismally, his voice low, dreary as his mind, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
mind dull as the dim room. Upon them Katy flashed
in her scarlet attire, her thin legs in their black
stockings completing her resemblance to a very
gorgeous tanager or grosbeak. Katy had recovered
from all her thrills; she was now pure mischief and
impertinence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing,&quot; complained Caleb Stemmel, &quot;nothing
is any more like it was when I was young.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it is much better,&quot; commented the scarlet
tanager.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We took always trouble.&quot; Caleb paid no heed
to the impertinent interruption. &quot;We had Christmas
entertainments that were entertainments&mdash;speeches
and cakes and apples and a Belsnickel. But
these children and these teachers, they are too lazy
and too good-for-nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy had no love for her teacher; she, too, considered
him good-for-nothing; but she had less love for
Caleb Stemmel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are going to have a Christmas entertainment
that will flax [beat] any of yours, Caleb Stemmel,&quot;
she boasted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, you will get up and say a few Dutch pieces
and then you will go home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, everything was Dutch when you were
young. You ought to like that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Things should now be English,&quot; insisted Caleb.
&quot;But you are too lazy, all of you, from the teacher
down. You will be pretty much ashamed of yourselves
this year, that I can tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
Katy was already halfway to the door, her black
legs flying. She would waste no words on Caleb
Stemmel. But now she turned and went back. Katy
was curious.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why this year?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because,&quot; teased Caleb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a dumb answer! Why <i>because</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because it is some one coming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A visitor.&quot; Caleb pronounced it &quot;wisitor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pooh! What do I care for a &#39;wisitor&#39;?&quot; mocked
Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is one that you care for!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you wish you knew?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy stamped her foot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you don&#39;t tell, I&#39;ll throw you with snow when
the snow comes,&quot; she threatened. Katy had respect
for age in general, but not for Caleb Stemmel.</p>

<p class="indent">Caleb did not answer until he saw that Danny
Koser was about to tell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a governor coming,&quot; he announced impressively.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy drew a step closer, her face aglow. No eyes
of tanager or grosbeak could have shone blacker
against brilliant plumage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean&quot;&mdash;faltered Katy&mdash;&quot;do you
mean that my Uncle Daniel is coming home once,
my Uncle Daniel Gaumer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The squire was here and he told us.&quot; Danny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
Koser was no longer to be restrained. &quot;Then he
went to your gran&#39;pop. He got a letter, the squire
did. What do you think of that now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what,&quot; jeered Caleb Stemmel,&mdash;&quot;what
will the governor think of Dutch Millerstown and
the Dutch entertainment and Dutch Katy; what&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Once more had Katy reached the door at the other
end of the long room. She had a habit of forecasting
her own actions; already she could see herself pounding
at the teacher&#39;s door, then racing home to her
grandfather&#39;s, her heart throbbing, throbbing, her
whole being in the glow of excitement which she
loved, and of which she never had enough.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly she stopped, her hand on the latch. She
had a secret, the whole Millerstown school had a
secret, but now it must be told. Every father and
mother in Millerstown would have to know if the
great project, really her great project, were to succeed.
Since the news would have to come out, it
might as well be announced at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are going to have an English entertainment,
Caleb Stemmel,&quot; she cried. &quot;It is planned this long
time already; we have been practicing for a month,
Caleb Stemmel. We will have you in it; we will have
you say, &#39;A wery wenimous wiper jumped out of a
winegar wat&#39;; that will be fine for you, Caleb. Aha!
Caleb!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Outside Katy paused and stretched forth her
arms. There was still not a soul in sight, there was
still not a sound; she looked up the street and down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
and could see the last house at each end. Then Katy
started to run. Ten minutes ago she had been only
little Katy Gaumer, with lessons learned for the
morrow and bedtime near, hating the quiet village,
a good deal bored with life; now she was Katy
Gaumer, the grandniece of one of the great men of
the world.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder what he will look like,&quot; said Katy.
&quot;I want to do something. I want to be something.
I want to make speeches. I want to be rich and
learned. I want to do <i>everything</i>. If he would only
help me, I might be <i>something</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was no one at hand to tell her that she was
a vain child; no one to remind her that she was only
one of twenty-odd grandnieces and nephews and
that the governor of a Western State was after all
not such an important person, since there were many
still higher offices in the land. No Millerstonian
would have so discounted Daniel Gaumer, who had
made his own way and had achieved greater success
than any of his Millerstown contemporaries. To
Katy he was far more wonderful than the President
of the United States. If she could do well at the entertainment&mdash;she,
of course, had the longest and
most important piece, and she had also drilled the
other children&mdash;if it only turned out well, and if
some one only said to the governor that success was
due to her efforts, he might persuade her grandfather
to send her away to school; he might&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">But this was not the time to dream. With a fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
gasp for breath, Katy ran on and hurled herself
against the teacher&#39;s door, or rather against the
door of Sarah Ann Mohr, in whose house the teacher
boarded. In an instant she was in the kitchen where
Sarah Ann and the teacher sat together.</p>

<p class="indent">Sarah Ann was large and ponderous and good-natured.
She was now reading the paper and hemming
a gingham apron by turns. Sarah Ann loved
to read. Her favorite matter was the inside page of
the Millerstown &quot;Star,&quot; which always offered varied
and interesting items of general news. Sarah Ann
was far less interested in the accounts of Millerstown&#39;s
births and deaths and marriages than she was
in the startling events of the world outside. Sarah
Ann&#39;s taste inclined to the shocking and morbid.
This evening she had read many times about a man
who had committed suicide by sitting on a box of
dynamite and lighting the fuse, and about a man
whose head was gradually becoming like that of a
lion. When she observed that the next item dealt
with the remarkable invention of a young woman
who baked glass in her husband&#39;s pies, Sarah Ann
laid down the paper to compose her mind with a
little sewing.</p>

<p class="indent">The teacher, who was small and slender and somewhat
near-sighted, was going painstakingly over a
bundle of civil service examination questions. He
was only in Millerstown for a little while, acting as
a substitute and waiting for something to turn up.
He was a Pennsylvania German, but he would as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
soon have been called a Turk. He had changed his
name from Schreiner to Carpenter and the very
sound of his native tongue was hateful to him. He
did not like Katy Gaumer; he did not like any
young, active, springing things.</p>

<p class="indent">Now he listened to Katy in astonishment. Katy
flung herself upon Sarah Ann.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Booh! Don&#39;t look so scared. I will not eat you,
Sarah Ann! And I am no spook! I am only in a
hurry. Teacher, I have told the people about the
English entertainment. It is out. I had to tell, because
the children must know their pieces better.
Ollie Kuhns, he won&#39;t learn his until his pop thrashes
him a couple of times, and Jimmie Weygandt&#39;s mom
will have to make him learn with a stick, and then
he will not know it anyhow, perhaps, and they won&#39;t
leave us have the Sunday School organ to practice
beforehand for the singing unless they know why it
is, and everybody must practice all the time from
now on. You see, I <i>had</i> to tell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The teacher looked at her dumbly. So did Sarah
Ann.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But <i>why</i>?&quot; asked they together.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; repeated Katy, impatiently, as though
they might have divined the wonderful reason.
&quot;Why, because my Uncle Daniel is coming. Isn&#39;t
that enough?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarah Ann laid down her apron.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bei meiner Seel&#39;!&quot; said she solemnly.</p>

<p class="indent">The teacher laid down his papers.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
&quot;The governor?&quot; said he. He had heard of Governor
Gaumer. He thought of the appointments in a
governor&#39;s power; he foresaw at once escape from
the teaching which he hated; he blessed Katy because
she had proposed an English entertainment.
He blessed her inspired suggestion of parental whippings
for Ollie and Jimmie. &quot;Sit down once, Katy,
sit down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It gave Katy another thrill of joy to be thus solicited
by her enemy. But now she could not stop.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must go first home and see my folks. Then I
will come back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the squire&#39;s gate, Bevy Schnepp awaited her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ach, come once in a little, Katy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just a little! I have something for you.&quot; Bevy
put out a futile arm. People were forever trying to
catch Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; laughed Katy. &quot;I&#39;ll put a hex on you,
Bevy! I&#39;ll bewitch you, Bevy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy was gone, through her grandfather&#39;s gate,
down the brick walk under the pine trees to the
kitchen where sat grandfather and grandmother and
the squire. Seeing them together, the two old men
with their broad shoulders and their handsome
heads and the old woman with her kindly face, a
stranger would have known at once where Katy got
her active, erect figure and her curly hair and her
dark eyes. All three were handsome; all three cultivated
as far as their opportunities would allow;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
all three would have been distinguished in a broader
circle than Millerstown could offer. But here circumstances
had placed them and had kept them.
Even the squire, whose desk was frequently littered
with time-tables, and who planned constantly journeys
to the uttermost parts of the earth, had scarcely
ever been away from Millerstown.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon these three Katy rushed like a whirlwind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it true?&quot; she demanded breathlessly in the
Pennsylvania German which the older folk loved,
but which was falling into disuse among the young.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is what true?&quot; asked grandfather and the squire
together. They liked to tease Katy, everybody liked
to tease Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That my uncle the governor is coming?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Grandfather Gaumer. &quot;Your uncle
the governor is coming.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br/>
THE BELSNICKEL</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the afternoon of the entertainment there was an
air of excitement, both within and without the
schoolroom. Outside the clouds hung low; the winter
wheat in the Weygandt fields seemed to have
yielded up some of its brilliant green; there was no
color on the mountain-side which had been warm
brown and purple in the morning sunshine. A snowstorm
was brewing, the first of the season, and Millerstown
rejoiced, believing that a green Christmas
makes a fat graveyard. But in spite of the threatening
storm nearly all Millerstown moved toward the
schoolhouse.</p>

<p class="indent">The schoolroom was almost unrecognizable. The
walls were naturally a dingy brown, except where
the blackboards made them still duller; the desks
were far apart; the distance from the last row, where
the ill-behaved liked to sit, to the teacher&#39;s desk, to
which they made frequent trips for punishment,
seemed on ordinary days interminable.</p>

<p class="indent">This afternoon, however, there was neither dullness
nor extra space. The walls were hidden by
masses of crowfoot and pine, brought from the mountain;
the blackboards had vanished behind festoons
of red flags and bunting. Into one quarter of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
room the children were so closely crowded that one
would have said they could never extricate themselves;
into the other three quarters had squeezed
and pressed their admiring relatives and friends.</p>

<p class="indent">Grandfather and Grandmother Gaumer were here,
the latter with a large and mysterious basket, which
she helped Katy to hide in the attic, the former
laughing with his famous brother. The governor had
come on the afternoon train, and Katy had scarcely
dared to look at him. He was tall,&mdash;she could see
that without looking,&mdash;and he had a deep, rich
voice and a laugh which made one smile to hear it.
&quot;Mommy Bets&quot; Eckert was here, a generation older
than the Gaumer men, and dear, fat Sarah Ann
Mohr, who would not have missed a Christmas entertainment
for anything you could offer her. There
were half a dozen babies who cooed and crowed by
turns, and at them cross Caleb Stemmel frowned&mdash;Caleb
was forever frowning; and there was Bevy
Schnepp, moving about like a restless grasshopper,
her bright, bead-like eyes on her beloved Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is a fine platform speaker, Katy is,&quot; boasted
Bevy to those nearest her. &quot;She will beat them all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin Koehler, tall, slender, good-looking even
to the eyes of older persons than Katy Gaumer, was
an usher; his presence was made clear to Katy rather
by a delicious thrill than by visual evidence. It
went without saying that his crazy father had not
come to the entertainment, though none of his small
businesses of bricklaying, gardening, or bee culture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
need have kept him away. When Koehler was not
at work, he spent no time attending entertainments;
he sat at his door or window, watching the mountain
road, and scolding and praying by turns.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon the last seat crouched David Hartman, sullen,
frowning, as ever. The school entertainment
was not worth the attention of so important a person
as his father, and his mother could not have
been persuaded to leave the constant toil with which
she kept spotless her great, beautiful house.</p>

<p class="indent">Millerstown&#39;s young bachelor doctor had come,
and he, too, watched Katy as she flew about in her
scarlet dress. The doctor was a Gaumer on his
mother&#39;s side, and from her had inherited the Gaumer
good looks and the Gaumer brains. Katy&#39;s Uncle
Edwin and her Aunt Sally had brought their little
Adam, a beautiful, blond little boy, who had his
piece to say on this great occasion. Uncle Edwin
was a Gaumer without the Gaumer brains, but he
had all the Gaumer kindness of heart. Of these two
kinsfolk, Uncle Edwin and fat, placid Aunt Sally,
Katy did not have a very high opinion. Smooth,
pretty little Essie Hill had not come; her pious soul
considered entertainments wicked.</p>

<p class="indent">But Katy gave no thought to Essie or to her absence;
her mind was full of herself and of the great
visitor and of Alvin Koehler. For Katy the play
had begun. The governor was here; he looked kind
and friendly; perhaps he would help her to carry
out some of her great plans for the future. Since his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
coming had been announced, Katy had seen herself
in a score of rôles. She would be a great teacher, she
would be a fine lady, she would be a missionary to
a place which she called &quot;Africay.&quot; No position
seemed beyond Katy&#39;s attainment in her present
mood.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy knew her part as well as she knew her own
name. It was called &quot;Annie and Willie&#39;s Prayer.&quot;
It was long and hard for a tongue, which, for all its
making fun of other people, could not itself say th
and v with ease. But Katy would not fail, nor would
her little cousin Adam, still sitting close between
his father and mother, whom she had taught to lisp
through &quot;Hang up the Baby&#39;s Stocking.&quot; If only
Ollie Kuhns knew the &quot;Psalm of Life,&quot; and Jimmie
Weygandt, &quot;There is a Reaper whose Name is
Death,&quot; as well! When they began to practice,
Ollie always said, &quot;Wives of great men,&quot; and Jimmie
always talked about &quot;deas&quot; for &quot;death.&quot; But
those faults had been diligently trained out of them.
All the children had known their parts this morning;
they had known them so well that Katy&#39;s elaborate
test could not produce a single blunder, but would
they know them now? Their faces grew whiter and
whiter; the very pine branches seemed to quiver with
nervousness; the teacher&mdash;Mr. Carpenter, indeed!&mdash;tried
in vain to recall the English speech which
he had written out and memorized. As he sat
waiting for the time to open the entertainment, he
frantically reminded himself that the prospect of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
examinations had always terrified him, but that he
invariably recovered his wits with the first question.</p>

<p class="indent">Once he caught Katy Gaumer&#39;s eye and tried to
smile. But Katy did not respond. Katy looked at
him sternly, as though she were the teacher and he
the pupil. She saw plainly enough what ailed him,
and prickles of fright went up and down her backbone.
His speech was to open the entertainment; if
he failed, everybody would fail. Katy had seen
panic sweep along the ranks of would-be orators in
the Millerstown school before this. She had seen
Jimmie Weygandt turn green and tremble like a
leaf; she had heard Ellie Schindler cry. If the teacher
would only let her begin the entertainment, she
would not fail!</p>

<p class="indent">But the teacher did not call on Katy. No such
simple way out of his difficulty occurred to his paralyzed
brain. The Millerstonians expected the fine
English entertainment to begin; the stillness in the
room grew deathlike; the moments passed, and Mr.
Carpenter sat helpless.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, suddenly, Mr. Carpenter jumped to his
feet, gasping with relief. He knew what he would do!
He would say nothing at all himself; he would call
upon the stranger. It was perfectly true that precedent
put a visitor&#39;s speech at the end of an entertainment,
rather than at the beginning, but the
teacher cared not a rap for precedent. The stranger
should speak now, and thus set an example to the
children. Hearing his easy <i>th&#39;s</i> and <i>v&#39;s</i>, they would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
have less trouble with their English. Color returned
to the teacher&#39;s cheeks; only Katy Gaumer
realized how terrified he had been. So elated was
he that he introduced the speaker without stumbling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is somebody here that we do not have often
with us at such a time,&quot; announced Mr. Carpenter.
&quot;It is a governor here; he will make us a speech.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The governor rose, smiling, and Millerstown,
smiling, also, craned its neck to see. Then Millerstown
prepared itself to hear. What it heard, it could
scarcely believe.</p>

<p class="indent">The governor had spoken for at least two minutes
before his hearers realized anything but a sharp
shock of surprise. The children looked and listened,
and gradually their mouths opened; the fathers and
mothers heard, and at once elbows sought neighboring
sides in astonished nudges. Bevy Schnepp
actually exclaimed aloud; Mr. Carpenter flushed a
brilliant, apoplectic red. Only Katy Gaumer sat un-moved,
being too much astonished to stir. She had
looked at the stranger with awe; she regarded him
now with incredulous amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">The governor had been away from Millerstown
for thirty years; he was a graduate of a university;
he had honorary degrees; the teacher had warned
the children to look as though they understood him
whether they understood him or not.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he asks you any English questions and you
do not know what he means, I will prompt you a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
little,&quot; the teacher had promised. &quot;You need only
to look once a little at me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the distinguished stranger asked no difficult
English questions; the distinguished stranger did
not even speak English; he spoke his own native,
unenlightened Pennsylvania German!</p>

<p class="indent">It came out so naturally, he seemed so like any
other Millerstonian standing there, that they could
hardly believe that he was distinguished and still
less that he was a stranger. He said that he had
not been in that schoolroom for thirty years, and
that if any one had asked him its dimensions, he
would have answered that it would be hard to throw
a ball from one corner to the other. And now from
where he stood he could almost touch its sides!</p>

<p class="indent">He remembered Caleb Stemmel and called him
by name, and asked whether he had any little boys
and girls there to speak pieces, at which everybody
laughed. Caleb Stemmel was too selfish ever to
have cared for anybody but himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Still talking as though he were sitting behind the
stove in the store with Caleb and Danny Koser and
the rest, the governor said suddenly an astonishing,
an incredible, an appalling thing. Mr. Carpenter,
already a good deal disgusted by the speaker&#39;s lack
of taste, did not realize at first the purport of his
statement, nor did the fathers and mothers, listening
entranced. But Katy Gaumer heard! <i>He said that
he had come a thousand miles to hear a Pennsylvania
German Christmas entertainment!</i></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
He said that it was necessary, of course, for every
child to learn English, that it was the language of
his fatherland; but that at Christmas time they
should remember that they had an older fatherland,
and that no nation felt the Christmas spirit like the
Germans. It was a time when everybody should be
grateful for his German blood, and should practice
his German speech. He said that a man with two
languages was twice a man. He had been looking
forward to this entertainment for weeks; he had
told his friends about it, and had made them curious
and envious; he had thought about it on the long
journey; he knew that there was one place where he
could hear &quot;Stille Nacht.&quot; He almost dared to hope
that this entertainment would have a Belsnickel.
If old men could be granted their dearest wish,
they would be young again. This entertainment, he
said, was going to make him young for one afternoon.</p>

<p class="indent">The great man sat down, and at once the little
man arose. Mr. Carpenter did not pause as though
he were frightened, he was no longer panic-stricken;
he was, instead, furious, furious with himself for
having called on Daniel Gaumer first, furious with
Daniel Gaumer for thus upsetting his teaching. He
said to himself that he did not care whether the
children failed or not. He announced &quot;Annie and
Willie&#39;s Prayer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed for a moment as though Katy herself
would fail. She stared into the teacher&#39;s eyes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
the teacher thought that she was crying. He could
not have prompted her if his life had depended upon
it. He glanced at the programme in his hand to see
who was to follow Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">But Katy had begun. Katy&#39;s tears were those of
emotion, not those of fright. She wore a red dress,
her best, which was even redder than her everyday
apparel; her eyes were bright, her cheeks flushed,
she moved lightly; she felt as though all the world
were listening, and as though&mdash;if her swelling
heart did not choke her before she began&mdash;as though
she might thrill the world. She knew how the stranger
felt; this was one of the moments when she, too,
loved Millerstown, and her native tongue and her
own people. The governor had come back; this was
his home; should he find it an alien place? No, Katy
Gaumer would keep it home for him!</p>

<p class="indent">Katy bowed to the audience, she bowed to the
teacher, she bowed to the stranger&mdash;she had effective,
stagey ways; then she began. To the staring
children, to the astonished fathers and mothers, to
the delighted stranger, she recited a new piece.
They had heard it all their lives, they could have
recited it in concert. It was not &quot;Annie and Willie&#39;s
Prayer&quot;; it was not even a Christmas piece; but it
was as appropriate to the occasion as either. It was
&quot;Das alt Schulhaus an der Krick,&quot; and the translation
compared with the original as the original
Christmas entertainment compared with Katy
Gaumer&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;To-day it is just twenty years</span><br />
<span class="i2">Since I began to roam;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Now, safely back, I stand once more,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Before the quaint old schoolhouse door,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Close by my father&#39;s home.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Katy was perfectly self-possessed throughout; it
must be confessed that praised and petted Katy was
often surer of herself than a child should be. There
were thirty-one stanzas in her recitation; there was
time to look at each one in her audience. At the
fathers and mothers she did not look at all; at Ollie
Kuhns and Jimmie Weygandt and little Sarah
Knerr, however, she looked hard and long. She was
still staring at Ollie when she reached her desk, staring
so hard that she scarcely heard the applause
which the stranger led. She did not sit down gracefully,
but hung halfway out of her seat, bracing herself
with her arm round little Adam and still gazing
at Ollie Kuhns. She had ceased to be an actor; she
was now stage-manager.</p>

<p class="indent">The teacher failed to announce Ollie&#39;s speech,
but no one noticed the omission. Ollie rose, grinning.
This was a beautiful joke to him. He knew
what Katy meant; he was always quick to understand.
Katy was not the only bright child in Millerstown.
He knew a piece entitled &quot;Der Belsnickel,&quot;
a description of the masked, fur-clad creature, the
St. Nicholas with a pelt, who in Daniel Gaumer&#39;s
day had brought cakes for good children and
switches for the &quot;nixnutzige.&quot; Ollie had terrified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
his schoolmates a hundred times with his representation
of &quot;Bosco, the Wild Man, Eats &#39;em Alive&quot;;
it would be a simple thing to make the audience see
a fearful Belsnickel.</p>

<p class="indent">And little Sarah Knerr, did she not know &quot;Das
Krischkindel,&quot; which told of the divine Christmas
spirit? She had learned it last year for a Sunday
School entertainment; now, directed by Katy, she
rose and repeated it with exquisite and gentle painstaking.
When Sarah had finished, Katy went to the
Sunday School organ, borrowed for the occasion, on
which she had taught herself to play. There was,
of course, only one thing to be sung, and that was
&quot;Stille Nacht.&quot; The children sang and their fathers
and mothers sang, and the stranger led them all
with his strong voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Only Katy Gaumer, fixing one after the other of
the remaining performers with her eye, sang no more
after the tune was started. There was Coonie Schnable;
she said to herself that he would fail in whatever
he tried to say. It would make little difference
whether Coonie&#39;s few unintelligible words were
English or German. Coonie had always been the
clown of the entertainments of the Millerstown
school; he would be of this one, also.</p>

<p class="indent">But Coonie did not fail. Ellie Schindler recited a
German description of &quot;The County Fair&quot; without
a break; then Coonie Schnable rose. He had
once &quot;helped&quot; successfully in a dialogue. For those
who know no Pennsylvania German it must suffice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
that the dialogue was a translation of a scene
in &quot;Hamlet.&quot; For the benefit of those who are
more fortunate, a translation is appended. Coonie
recited all the parts, and also the names of the
speakers.</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p class="indent">To the children Coonie&#39;s least word and slightest
motion were convulsing; now they shrieked with
glee, and their fathers and mothers with them. The
stranger seemed to discover still deeper springs of
mirth; he laughed until he cried.</p>

<p class="indent">Only Katy, stealing out, was not there to see the
end. Nor was she at hand to speed little Adam, who
was to close the entertainment with &quot;Hang up the
Baby&#39;s Stocking.&quot; But little Adam had had his
whispered instructions. He knew no German recitation&mdash;this
was his first essay at speech-making&mdash;but
he knew a German Bible verse which his Grandmother
Gaumer had taught him, &quot;Ehre sei Gott in
der Höhe, und Friede auf Erden, und Den Menschen
ein Wohlgefallen.&quot; (Glory to God in the Highest
and on earth, peace, good will toward men.) He
looked like a Christmas spirit as he said it, with his
flaxen hair and his blue eyes, as the stranger might
have looked sixty years ago. Daniel Gaumer started
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
the applause, and as little Adam passed him, lifted
him to his knee.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not like the Millerstonians to have any entertainment
without refreshments, and for this entertainment
refreshments had been provided. Grandmother
Gaumer&#39;s basket was filled to the brim with
cookies, ginger-cakes, sand-tarts, flapjacks, in all
forms of bird and beast and fish, and these Katy
went to the attic to fetch. She ran up the steps;
she had other and more exciting plans than the
mere distribution of the treat.</p>

<p class="indent">In the attic, by the window, sullen, withdrawn
as usual, sat David Hartman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must get out of here,&quot; ordered Katy in her
lordly way. &quot;I have something to do here, and you
must go quickly. You ought to be ashamed to sit
here alone. You are always ugly. Perhaps&quot;&mdash;this
both of them knew was flippant nonsense&mdash;&quot;perhaps
you have been after my cakes!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David made no answer; he only looked at her from
under his frowning brows, then shambled down the
steps and out the door into the cold, gray afternoon.
Let him take his sullenness and meanness
away! Then Katy&#39;s bright eyes began to search the
room.</p>

<p class="indent">In another moment, down in the schoolroom,
little Adam cried out and hid his face against the
stranger&#39;s breast; then another child screamed in
excited rapture. The Belsnickel had come! It was
covered with the dust of the schoolhouse attic; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
was not of the traditional huge size&mdash;it was, indeed,
less than five feet tall; but it wore a furry
coat&mdash;the distinguished stranger leaped to his feet,
saying that it was not possible that that old pelt
still survived!&mdash;it opened its mouth &quot;like scissors,&quot;
as Ollie Kuhns&#39;s piece had said. It had not the traditional
bag, but it had a basket, Grandmother Gaumer&#39;s,
and the traditional cakes were there. It
climbed upon a desk, its black-stockinged legs and
red dress showing through the rents of the old,
ragged coat, and the children surrounded it, laughing,
begging, screaming with delight.</p>

<p class="indent">The stranger stood and looked at Katy. He did
not yet realize how large a part she had had in the
entertainment, though about that a proud grandfather
would soon inform him; he saw the Gaumer
eyes and the Gaumer bright face, and he remembered
with sharp pain the eyes of a little sister gone fifty
years ago.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is that child?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy&#39;s grandfather called her to him, and she
came slowly, slipping like a crimson butterfly from
the old coat, which the other children seized upon
with joy. She heard the governor&#39;s question and
her grandfather&#39;s answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is my Abner&#39;s only child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Katy&#39;s eyes met the stranger&#39;s bright gaze.
She halted in the middle of the room, as though she
did not know exactly what she was doing. Their
praise embarrassed her, her foolish anger at David
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
Hartman hurt her, her head swam. Even her joy
seemed to smother her. This great man had hated
Millerstown, as she hated Millerstown, sometimes,
or he would not have gone away; he had loved it as
she did, or he would not have come back to laugh
and weep with his old friends. Perhaps he, too, had
wanted everything and had not known how to get
it; perhaps he, too, had wanted to fly and had not
known where to find wings! A consciousness of his
friendliness, of his kinship, seized upon her. He
would understand her, help her! And like the child
she was, Katy ran to him. Indeed, he understood
even now, for stooping to kiss her, he hid her foolish
tears from Millerstown.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br/>
THE GREAT MAN</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On</span> ordinary Christmas days, when only the squire
and the doctor and Uncle Edwin and Aunt Sally
and little Adam and Bevy Schnepp dined at Grandfather
Gaumer&#39;s, Grandmother Gaumer and Bevy
prepared a fairly elaborate feast. There was always
a turkey, a twenty-five pounder with potato filling,
there were all procurable vegetables, there were
always cakes and pies and preserves and jellies without
number. One gave one&#39;s self up with cheerful
helplessness to indigestion, one resigned one&#39;s self
to next day&#39;s headache&mdash;that is, if one were not a
Gaumer. No Gaumer ever had headache.</p>

<p class="indent">It cannot be claimed for Katy that she was of
much assistance to her elders on this Christmas Day,
tall girl though she was. Grandfather Gaumer and
the governor started soon after breakfast to pay
calls in the village and her thoughts were with them.
How glad every one would be to see the governor;
how they would press cakes and candy upon him;
how he would joke with them; how they would treasure
what he said! What a wonderful thing it was to
be famous and to have every one admire you!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would keep the chair he sat in,&quot; said Katy.
&quot;I would put it away and keep it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
Presently Katy saw Katy Gaumer coming back
to her native Millerstown, covered with honors, of
what sort Katy did not exactly know, and going
about on Christmas morning to see the Millerstown
Christmas trees and to receive the homage of a
delighted community.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, Katy tripped over her own feet and
sent a dish flying from the kitchen table, and started
to fill the teakettle from the milk-pitcher. Finally,
to Bevy Schnepp&#39;s disgust, Katy spilled the salt.
Bevy was as much one of the party as the governor.
She moved swiftly about, her little face twisted into
a knot, profoundly conscious of the importance of
her position as assistant to the chief cook on this
great day, her shrill voice now breathing forth commands,
now recounting strange tales. Grandmother
Gaumer, to whose kitchen Bevy was a thrice daily
visitor, had long ago accustomed herself not to listen
to the flow of speech, and had thereby probably
saved her own reason.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You fetch me hurry a few coals, Katy. Now
don&#39;t load yourself down so you cannot walk!
&#39;The more haste the less speed!&#39; Adam, you take
your feet to yourself or they will get stepped on for
sure. Gran&#39;mom, your pies! You better get them
out or they burn to nothing! Go in where the Putz
is, Adam, then you are not all the time under the
folks&#39; feet. Sally Edwin, you peel a few more potatoes
for me, will you, Sally, for the mashed potatoes?
Mashed potatoes go down like nothing. Ach, I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
the worst time with my supper yesterday! The
chicken wouldn&#39;t get, and the governor was there.
I tell you, the Old Rip was in it! But I carried the
pan three times round the house and then it done
fine for me. Katy, if you take another piece of celery,
I&#39;ll teach you the meaning. To eat my nice
celery that I cleaned for dinner! And the hard, yet!
If you want celery, fetch some for yourself and clean
it and eat it. I&#39;d be ashamed, Katy, a big girl like
you! You want to be so high gelernt, you think you
are a platform speaker, yet you would eat celery
out of the plate. Look out, the salt, Katy! Well,
Katy! Would you spill the salt, yet! Do you want
to put a hex on everything? I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bevy!&quot; Katie exploded with alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot; cried Bevy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your mouth is open!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I&mdash;&quot; Bevy gurgled, then gasped. Bevy was
not slow on the uptake. &quot;I opened it, I opened it
a-purpose to tell you what I think of you. I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Katy, hearing an opening door, had gone,
dancing into the sitting-room, where, on great days
like this, the feast was spread. The room was larger
than the kitchen; in the center stood the long table,
and in one corner was the Christmas tree with the
elaborate &quot;Putz,&quot; a garden in which miniature
sheep and cows walked through forests and swans
swam on glass lakelets. Before the &quot;Putz,&quot; entranced,
sat fat Adam; near by, beside the shiny
&quot;double-burner,&quot; the governor and his brothers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
and young Dr. Benner were establishing themselves.
The governor had still a hundred questions
to ask.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy perched herself on the arm of her grandfather&#39;s
chair, saying to herself that Bevy might
call forever now and she would not answer. The
odor of roasting turkey filled the house, intoxicating
the souls of hungry men, but it was not half so
potent as this breath of power, this atmosphere of
the great world of affairs, which surrounded Great-Uncle
Gaumer. Katy&#39;s heart thumped as she listened;
the great, vague plans which she had made
in the night seemed at one moment possible of execution,
at the next absolutely mad. Her face flushed
and her skin pricked as she thought of making known
her desires; her heart seemed to sink far below its
proper resting-place. She listened to the governor
with round, excited eyes, now praying for courage,
now yielding to despair.</p>

<p class="indent">The governor&#39;s questions did not refer to the
great world,&mdash;it seemed as though the world had
become of no account to him,&mdash;but to Millerstown,
the Millerstown of his youth, of apple-butter
matches, of raffles, of battalions, of the passing
through of troops to the war, of the rough preachers
of a stirring age. He remembered many things which
his brothers had forgotten; they and the younger
folk listened entranced. As for Bevy, moving about
on tiptoe, so as not to miss a word,&mdash;it was a marvel
that she was able to finish the dinner.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
&quot;He traveled on horseback,&quot; said the governor.
&quot;He had nothing to his name in all the world but his
horse and his old saddlebags, and he visited the
people whether they wanted him or not. At our
house he was always welcome,&mdash;he stayed once a
whole winter,&mdash;and on Sundays he used to give
it to us in church, I can tell you! Everything he&#39;d
yell out that would come into his mind. One Sunday
he yelled at me, &#39;There you stand in the choir,
and you couldn&#39;t get a pig&#39;s bristle between your
teeth. Sing out, Daniel!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he could preach powerfully! He made the
people listen! There was no sleeping in the church
when he was in the pulpit. If the young people did
not pay attention, he called right out, &#39;John, behave!
Susy, look at me!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have such a preacher here,&quot; said Uncle Edwin
in his slow way. &quot;He is a Improved New Mennonite.
He&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They wear hats with Scripture on them, and
they sing, &#39;If you love your mother, keep her in the
sky,&#39;&quot; interrupted Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;<i>Meet</i> her in the sky,&#39;&quot; corrected Grandmother
Gaumer. &quot;That has some sense to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He won&#39;t read the words as they are written in
the Bible,&quot; went on Uncle Edwin, apparently not
minding the interruption. He shared with the rest
of Katy&#39;s kin their foolish opinion of Katy. &quot;He
says the words that are printed fine don&#39;t belong
there, they are put in. It is like riding on a bad road,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
his reading. It goes bump, bump. It sounds very
funny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He preaches on queer texts,&quot; said Katy. &quot;He
preached on &#39;She Fell in Love with her Mother-in-Law.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Katy!&quot; admonished Grandmother Gaumer.</p>

<p class="indent">Bevy Schnepp had endured as much as she could
of insult to the denomination to which she belonged
and to the preacher under whom she sat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Lutheran preachers have &#39;kein Saft und
kein Kraft, kein Salz und kein Peffer&#39; [no sap and
no strength, no salt and no pepper],&quot; she quoted.
&quot;They are me too leppish [insipid]. You must give
these things a spiritual meaning. It meant Naomi
and Ruth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The governor smiled his approval at Bevy. &quot;Right
you are, Bevy!&quot; Then he began to ask questions
about his former acquaintances.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What has come over John Hartman?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;While he is so cross, you mean?&quot; said Grandfather
Gaumer. &quot;I don&#39;t know what has come over
him. It is a strange thing. He is so long queer that
we forget he was ever any other way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was he ugly this morning?&quot; asked Grandmother
Gaumer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He didn&#39;t ask us to come in and she didn&#39;t
come to the door at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bevy Schnepp, entering with laden hands, made
sharp comment.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
&quot;She is afraid her things will get spoiled if the sun
or the moon or the cold air strikes them. She is
crazy for cleanness. She will get yet like fat Abby.
Fat Abby once washed her hands fifteen times before
breakfast, and if he (her husband) touched the
coffee-pot even to push it back with his finger if it
was boiling over, then she would make fresh.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And do the Koehlers still live on the mountain?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are only two Koehlers left,&quot; answered the
squire, &quot;William and his boy.&quot; The squire shook
his head solemnly. &quot;It is a queer thing about the
Koehlers, too. The others were honest and right
in their minds, but William, he is none of these
things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not <i>honest</i>!&quot; said the governor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About fifteen years ago he did some bricklaying
at the church and he had the key of the communion
cupboard. The solid service was there and while he
was working it disappeared.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Disappeared!&quot; repeated the governor. &quot;You
mean he took it? What could he do with it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know. Nobody knows. He goes about
muttering and praying over it. They say his boy
hardly gets enough to eat. I can&#39;t understand it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He!&quot; Bevy now had the great turkey platter in
her arms; its weight and her desire to express herself
made her gasp. &quot;He! He looks at a penny till
it is a twenty-dollar gold-piece. And you ought to
see his boy! He is for all the world like a girl. &#39;Like
father, like son!&#39; He&#39;ll do something, too, yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
Katy slid from the arm of her grandfather&#39;s chair,
her cheeks aflame.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have to look at pennies when you are poor,&quot;
she protested. &quot;You can&#39;t throw money round when
you don&#39;t have it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bevy slid the platter gently to its place on the
table, then she faced about.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, listen once!&quot; cried she with admiration.
&quot;You can&#39;t throw money round when you don&#39;t
have it, can&#39;t you? What do you know about it, you
little chicken?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy&#39;s face flushed a deeper crimson. If looks
could have slain, Bevy would have dropped. Young
Dr. Benner turned and looked at Katy suddenly
and curiously. She would have gone on expostulating
had not Grandmother Gaumer risen and the
other Gaumers with her, all moving with one accord
toward the feast. There was time only for a secret
and threatening gesture toward Bevy, then Katy
bent her head with the rest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;The eyes of all wait upon Thee,&#39;&quot; said Grandfather
Gaumer in German. &quot;&#39;Thou givest them
their meat in due season.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Heartily the Gaumers began upon the Christmas
feast, the feast beside which the ordinary Christmas
dinner was so poor and simple a thing. Here was
the turkey, done to a turn, here were all possible
vegetables, all possible pies and cakes and preserves.
To these Grandmother Gaumer had added a few
common side-dishes, so that her brother-in-law
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
might not return to the West without a taste, at
least, of all the staple foods of his childhood. There
was a slice of home-raised, home-cured ham; there
was a piece of smoked sausage; there was a dish of
Sauerkraut and a dish of &quot;Schnitz und Knöpf,&quot;&mdash;these
last because the governor had mentioned them
yesterday in his speech. It was well that the squire
lived next door and that Bevy had her own stove to
use as well as Grandmother Gaumer&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">Bevy occupied the chair nearest the kitchen door.
There are few class distinctions in Millerstown,
though one is not expected to leave the station in
life in which he was born. It was proper for Bevy
to occupy the position of maid and for little Katy
to go to school. If Katy had undertaken to live out,
or Bevy to become learned, Millerstown would
have disapproved of both of them. When each remained
in her place, they were equal.</p>

<p class="indent">The governor tasted all the dishes serenely, and
Grandmother Gaumer apologized from beginning
to end, as is polite in Millerstown. The turkey might
have been heavier&mdash;if he had, he would certainly
have perished long before Grandfather&#39;s axe was
sharpened for him! The pie might have been flakier,
the sausage might have been smoked a bit longer&mdash;it
would have been sinful to add a breath of smoke
to what was already perfect.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then it wouldn&#39;t have been ready for to-day!&quot;
said the governor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we might have begun earlier.&quot; Grandmother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
Gaumer would not yield her point. &quot;If we
had butchered two days earlier, it would have been
better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When human power could do no more, when Bevy
had no more breath for urgings, such as, &quot;Ach, eat
it up once, so it gets away!&quot; or &quot;Ach, finish it; it
stood round long enough already!&quot; the Gaumers
pushed back their chairs and talked with mellower
wit and softer hearts of old times, of father and
mother and grandparents, and of the little sister
who had died.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was just thirteen,&quot; said Governor Gaumer.
&quot;She was the liveliest little girl! I often think if she
had lived, she would have made of herself something
different from the other people in Millerstown. But
now she would have been an old woman, think of
that!&quot; The governor held out his hand and Katy
came across to him, her eyes filled with tears. Katy
was always easily moved. &quot;Didn&#39;t she look like
this one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; agreed Grandfather Gaumer. &quot;That I
always said.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The governor laid both his hands on Katy&#39;s
shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what&quot;&mdash;said he,&mdash;&quot;what are you going
to do in this world, Miss Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy looked up at him with a deep, deep breath.
She had thought that yesterday held a great moment,
but here was a much greater one. She clasped
her hands, she gasped again, she looked the governor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
straight in the face. Here was her opportunity, the
opportunity which she had begun to think would
never come.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ach,&quot; said Katy with a deep sigh, &quot;when I am
through the Millerstown school, I should like to go
to a big school and learn <i>everything</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The governor smiled upon her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everything, Katy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; sighed Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen to her once!&quot; cried Bevy Schnepp with
pride.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t you learn enough here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am already in the next to the highest class,&quot;
explained Katy. &quot;And our teacher, he is not a very
good one. He wants to be English and a teacher
ought to be English, but he is werry Germaner than
the scholars. He said to us in school, &#39;We are to have
nothing but English here, <i>do you versteh</i>?&#39; That is
exactly the way he said it to us. He says lots of
words that are not English. I want to be English.
I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just listen now!&quot; cried Bevy again, her hands
piled high with dishes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to be well educated,&quot; finished Katy with
glowing cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what would you do when you were educated?&quot;
asked the governor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would leave Millerstown,&quot; said Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; asked the governor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be no use having an education in Millerstown,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
answered Katy with conviction. &quot;You
have no idea how slow Millerstown is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And where did you think you would go?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps to Phildel&#39;phy,&quot; answered Katy. &quot;Perhaps
I would be a missionary to Africay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Strange sounds issued from the throats of Katy&#39;s
kin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are sure you could do nothing in Millerstown
with an education?&quot; asked the governor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is nothing to do here,&quot; explained Katy. &quot;You
can walk round Millerstown a whole evening and
you don&#39;t hear anything and you don&#39;t see anything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would she like <i>murders</i>?&quot; demanded Bevy
Schnepp.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You go in the store and Caleb Stemmel and
Danny Koser are too dumb and lazy even to read
the paper, and Sarah Ann Mohr is hemming and
everybody else is sleeping. The married people sit
round and don&#39;t say anything, and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you want them to <i>fight</i>?&quot; Bevy was not discouraged
by being ignored.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You think it would be better to be a missionary?&quot;
said the governor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be better to be <i>anything</i>,&quot; declared
Katy fervently. &quot;I <i>cannot stand</i> Millerstown!&quot;
Katy clasped her hands and looked into the face of
her distinguished relative. &quot;Oh, please, please make
them send me away to a big school! I prayed for
it!&quot; added Katy.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
Over Katy&#39;s head the eyes of her elders met. The
older folk thought of the little girl who might have
been something different, the squire remembered
the journeys he had planned in his youth and the
years he had waited to take them.</p>

<p class="indent">But to Katy&#39;s chagrin and bitter disappointment,
no one said another word about an education.
Grandmother Gaumer suggested that Katy might
help Aunt Sally and Bevy with the dishes. Afterwards,
Katy was called upon to say her piece once
more. When little Adam followed with his Bible
verse and was given equal praise, Katy&#39;s poor heart,
sinking lower and lower, reached the most depressed
position which it is possible for a heart to assume.
Her cause was lost.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the governor prepared to start on his long
journey to the West. There he had grown sons and
daughters and little grandchildren whom these
Eastern cousins might never see. He kissed Grandmother
Gaumer and his niece Sally and little Adam
and Katy, and shook hands with Bevy Schnepp,
then he returned and kissed Grandmother Gaumer
once more. There was something solemn in his farewell;
at sight of Grandmother Gaumer&#39;s face Katy
was keenly conscious once more of her own despair.
From the window she watched the three old men go
down the street, the famous man who had gone away
from Millerstown and the two who had stayed. It
seemed to Katy that the two were less noble because
of the obscurity of their lives.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
&quot;Why did gran&#39;pop stay here always?&quot; she
asked when she and her grandmother were alone.
&quot;Why did uncle go away?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gran&#39;pop was the oldest, and he and the squire
had to stay here. Uncle had the chance to go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But&mdash;&quot; Katy crossed to her grandmother&#39;s
side. Everything was still in the warm, pine-scented
room. &quot;But, grandmother, why do you
cry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not crying,&quot; said grandmother brightly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you look&mdash;you look as if&quot;&mdash;Katy struggled
for words in which to express her thoughts&mdash;&quot;as if
everything were finished!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandmother sighed gently. &quot;I am an old woman,
Katy, and your uncle is an old man. We may never
see each other again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear! oh, dear!&quot; cried Katy. &quot;This is a
very sad Christmas!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was not the sadness of parting which made
Katy cry. It was unthinkable that anything should
change for her. Everything would be the same, always&mdash;alas,
that it should be so! She, Katy Gaumer,
with all her smartness in school, and all her
ability to plan and manage entertainments, would
stay here in this spot until she died. Grandmother
Gaumer, reproaching herself, comforted her for that
which was not a grief at all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will be here a long time yet. And you are
to go away to school, and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy sprang to her feet.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
&quot;Who says it, gran&#39;mom? Who says I dare go to
school?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your gran&#39;pop said it, and your uncles said it
when you were out with Bevy. You are to study
here till you are through with the highest class, then
you are to go away. Your uncle will find a school:
he will send us catalogues and he will give us advice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy clasped her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not deserve it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You said you prayed for it,&quot; reminded Grandmother
Gaumer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I prayed without faith,&quot; confessed Katy.
&quot;I did not believe for one little minute it would
ever come true in this world!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Grandmother Gaumer, &quot;it is coming
true.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here for once was bliss without alloy, here was
a rapture without reaction. Christmas entertainments,
at which one did well, ended; there was no
outlook from them, and it was the same with perfect
recitations in school. But this was different.
One had the moment&#39;s complete joy, one had also
something much better.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must study,&quot; planned Katy. &quot;I must learn.
I must make&quot;&mdash;alas, that one&#39;s joy should be another&#39;s
bitter trial!&mdash;&quot;I must make that teacher
learn me everything he knows!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was dusk when Grandfather Gaumer came
home.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
&quot;I told Katy,&quot; said Grandmother Gaumer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Daniel gave me two hundred dollars to put in
the bank in Katy&#39;s name,&quot; announced Grandfather
Gaumer solemnly. &quot;It shall be spent for books and
to start Katy. He and the squire and I will see her
through.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy flung herself upon her grandfather.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will learn everything,&quot; she promised. &quot;I will
make you proud of me. Like it says in the Sunday
School book, &#39;I will bring home my sheaves.&#39; And
now,&quot; said Katy, &quot;I am going to run out to the
schoolhouse and back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In an instant she was gone, scarlet shawl about
her, slamming the door. Perhaps the two old people
sitting together were not sorry to have her away
for a while. The day with its memories and its parting
had been hard, and the mere youthfulness of
youth is sometimes difficult for age to bear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her legs fly like the arms of a windmill,&quot; said
Grandfather Gaumer.</p>

<p class="indent">Then they sat silently together.</p>

<p class="indent">Already Katy was halfway out to the schoolhouse.
The threatened snow had fallen and the sky had
cleared at sunset. There was still a faint, rosy glow
in the west, a glow which was presently dimmed by
the brighter light which spread over the landscape
as the cinder ladle at the furnace turned out its
fiery charge upon the cinder bank. When that flame
faded, the stars were shining brightly; Katy stood
in the road before the schoolhouse and looked up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
at them and then round about her. The schoolhouse,
glorified by her recent triumph, was further sanctified
by her great hopes. Beside it on the hillside
stood the little church, where she had been confirmed
and had had her first communion, where during
the long German sermons she had dreamed
many dreams, and where she had been thrilled by
solemn watch-night services. Millerstown was not
without power to impress itself even upon one who
hated it.</p>

<p class="indent">Now Katy raced down the hill. But she was not
ready to go into the house. She shrieked into Bevy
Schnepp&#39;s kitchen window; she almost upset Caleb
Stemmel as he plodded to his place behind the stove
in the store, wishing that there were no Christmases;
she ran once more to the end of Locust Street
and across to Church Street and looked through the
thick trees at the Hartman house. David had surely
some handsome Christmas gifts from his parents.
Then, straining her eyes, she gazed up at the little
white house on the mountain-side. There was not
much Christmas there, that was certain, but Alvin
was there, handsome, adorable. Alvin would pay
heed to her if she was going away, the one person
in Millerstown to be educated!</p>

<p class="indent">Then Katy stretched out her arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear Millerstown!&quot; cried Katy. &quot;Oh, dear,
dumb Millerstown, I am going away from you!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br/>
THE KOEHLERS&#39; CHRISTMAS DAY</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">At</span> Grandfather Gaumer&#39;s house, where the governor
dined; at the Weygandt farm where there
was another great family dinner; at the Kuhnses,
where Ollie still swelled proudly over yesterday&#39;s
oratorical triumph; at Sarah Ann Mohr&#39;s, where ten
indigent guests filled themselves full of fat duck,&mdash;indeed,
one might say at every house in Millerstown,
there was feasting. The very air smelled
of roasting and boiling and frying, and the birds
passing overhead stopped and settled hopefully
on trees and roofs.</p>

<p class="indent">But in the house of William Koehler, just above
Millerstown on the mountain road, there was no
turkey or goose done to a turn, there were no pies,
there was no fine-cake. Here was no mother or
grandmother to make preserves or to compound
mincemeat in preparation for this day of days.
What mother there had been was seldom thought
of in the little house.</p>

<p class="indent">Here the day passed like any other day, except
that it was duller and less tolerable. There was no
school for Alvin and no work for his father, and they
had to spend the long hours together. Alvin did not
like school, but to-day he would cheerfully have gone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
before daylight and have remained until dark. His
father did not like holidays; they removed the goal,
for which he worked and of which he thought night
and day, a little farther away from him. He would
have preferred to work every day, even on Sundays.</p>

<p class="indent">William was a mason by trade, but when there
was no mason work for him, he was willing to turn
his hand to anything which would bring him a little
money. Another mason had recently established
himself in the village, urged, it was supposed, by
those who were unwilling to admit Koehler to their
houses for the occasional bits of plastering which had
to be done. There was no question that Koehler
was very queer. Not only was he likely to kneel
down at any moment and begin to pray, but he did
other singular things. He had once worked until two
o&#39;clock in the afternoon without his dinner, because
his watch had stopped and he had not sense enough to
know it. It was not strange that thrifty Millerstown
agreed that he was not a safe person to have about.</p>

<p class="indent">Between him and his son there was little sympathy;
there was, indeed, seldom speech. Alvin was
bitterly ashamed of his father, of his miserly ways, of
his shabby clothes, and above all, of his insane habit
of praying. William prayed incoherently about the
communion service which he was supposed to have
stolen&mdash;at least, that was what seemed to be the
burden of his petition. Whether he prayed for grace
to return it, or for forgiveness for having taken it,
Millerstown did not know, so confused was his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
speech. Alvin&#39;s position was a hard one. He was
humiliated by the taunts of the Millerstown boys;
he hated the poverty of his life; he was certain that
never had human being been so miserable.</p>

<p class="indent">Early on Christmas morning the two had had
their breakfast together in the kitchen of the little
white house where they lived, and there Alvin had
made an astonishing request. Alvin was fond of fine
clothes; there was a certain red tie in the village
store at which he had looked longingly for days.
Alvin was given to picturing himself, as Katy Gaumer
pictured herself, in conspicuous and important
positions in the eyes of men. Alvin&#39;s coveted distinction,
however, was of fine apparel, and not of
superior education. He liked to be clean and tidy;
he disliked rough play and rough work which disarranged
his clothes and soiled his hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ach, pop,&quot; he begged, &quot;give me a Christmas
present!&quot; His eyes filled with tears, he had been
cruelly disappointed because he had found no way
to get the tie in time for the Christmas entertainment.
&quot;Everybody has a Christmas present!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A Christmas present!&quot; repeated William Koehler,
his quick, darting eyes shining with amazement.
His were not mean features; he had the mouth of a
generous man, and his eyes were full and round.
But between his brows lay a deep depression, as
though experience had moulded his forehead into
a shape for which nature had not intended it. If it
had not been for that deep wrinkle, one would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
said that he was a gentle, kindly, humorous soul.
&quot;A Christmas present!&quot; said he again.</p>

<p class="indent">Without making any further answer, he rose and
went out the kitchen door and down the board walk
toward the chicken house. He repeated the monstrous
request again and again, like a person of
simple mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A Christmas present! He asks me for a Christmas
present!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When he reached the chicken house, he stood still,
leaning against the fence. The chickens clustered
about him with crowings and squawkings, some flying
to his shoulders. Birds and beasts and insects
loved and trusted poor William if human beings did
not. It was possible for him to go about among his
bees and handle them as he would without fear of
stings.</p>

<p class="indent">Now he paid no heed to the flapping, eager fowl,
except to thrust them away from him. He stood
leaning against the fence and looking down upon
the gray landscape. It was not yet quite daylight
and the morning was cloudy. The depression in his
forehead deepened; he was looking fixedly at one
spot, John Hartman&#39;s house, as though he had never
seen it before, or as though he meant to fix it in his
mind forever.</p>

<p class="indent">The Hartman house was always there. He had
seen it a thousand times, would see it a thousand
times more. On moonlight nights, its wide roofs
glittered, on dark nights a gleaming lamp set on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
post before the door fixed it in place. In winter its
light and its great bulk, in summer its girdle of trees,
distinguished it from all the other houses in Millerstown.
William Koehler could see it from every foot
of his little house and garden. It was before his eyes
when he worked among his plants, which seemed
to love him also, and when he sat for a few minutes
on his porch, and when he tended his bees or fed his
chickens.</p>

<p class="indent">Beyond the Hartman house he did not look. There
the country spread out in a wide, cultivated, varicolored
plain, with the mountains bounding it far
away. To the right of the village was the little cemetery
where his wife lay buried, and near it the Lutheran
church to which they had both belonged, but
he glanced at neither. Sometimes he could see John
Hartman helping his wife from the carriage when
they returned from church, or stamping the snow
from his feet before he stepped into his buggy in the
stable yard. Often, at this sight, when there was
no one within hearing, William waved his arms and
shouted, as though nothing but a wild sound could
express his emotion. He was not entirely free from
the superstitions in which Bevy and many other
Millerstonians believed, superstitions long since
seared upon the souls of a persecuted generation in
the fatherland. He recited the strange verse, supposed
to ward away evil,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Dulix, ix, ux,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thou comest not over Pontio,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Pontio is over Pilato!&quot;&mdash;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
and he carried about with him a little spray of five-finger
grass as a charm.</p>

<p class="indent">When John Hartman drove along the mountain
road, his broad shoulders almost filling his buggy,
William had more than once shouted an insane accusation
at him. This Millerstown did not know.
Koehler never spoke thus unless they were alone,
and Hartman told no one of the encounter. One is
not likely to tell the world that he has been accused
of stealing, even though the accuser is himself
known to be a madman and a thief. But John Hartman
came presently to avoid the mountain road.</p>

<p class="indent">After a while William roused himself and fed his
chickens and looked once more at the house of John
Hartman. There was smoke rising from the chimney,
and tears came into William&#39;s eyes, as though the
smoke had drifted across the fields and had blinded
him. Suddenly he struck the sharp paling a blow with
his hard hand and spoke aloud, not with his usual
faltering and mumbling tongue, but clearly and
straightforwardly. William had found a help and a
defense.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will tell him!&quot; cried he. &quot;This day I will tell
my son, Alvin!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All the long, snowy Christmas morning, Alvin sat
about the house. He did not read because he had no
books, and besides, he did not care much for books.
Alvin was a very handsome boy, but he did not have
much mind. He did not sing or whistle on this Christmas
morning because he was not cheerful; he did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
not whittle because whittling would have wasted
both knife and stick, and his father would have reproved
him. He did not walk out because he was not
an active boy like David Hartman, and he did not
visit because he was not liked in Millerstown. He
did not take a boy&#39;s part in the games; he was afraid
to swim and dive; he whined when he was hurt.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked out the window toward the Hartman
house with a vague envy of David, who had so much
while he had so little. He watched his father&#39;s
parsimonious preparation of the simple meal&mdash;how
Grandmother Gaumer and Bevy Schnepp
would have exclaimed at a Christmas dinner of
butcher&#39;s ham!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, the poor souls!&quot; Grandmother Gaumer
would have cried. &quot;I might easily have invited
them to us to eat!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where does the money go, then?&quot; Bevy would
have demanded. &quot;He surely earns enough to have
anyhow a chicken on Christmas! Where does he put
his money? No sugar in the coffee! Just potatoes
fried in ham fat for vegetables!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All the long afternoon, also, Alvin sat about the
house. He did not think again of the Hartmans; he
did not think of Katy Gaumer, who thought so frequently
of him; he thought of the red tie and wished
that he had money to buy it.</p>

<p class="indent">All the long afternoon his father huddled close
to the other side of the stove and muttered to himself
as though he were preparing whatever he meant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
to tell Alvin. It must be either a very puzzling or a
very long story, or one which required careful rehearsing.
When the sun, setting in a clear sky, had
touched the top of a mountain far across the plain,
he began to speak suddenly, as though he had given
to himself the departure of day for a signal. He
did not make an elaborate account of the strange
events he had to relate; on the contrary, he could
hardly have omitted a word and have had his meaning
clear. He said little of Alvin&#39;s mother; he drew
no deductions; he simply told the story.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Alvin!&quot; cried he, sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin looked up. His head had sunk on his breast;
he was at this moment half asleep. He was startled
not alone by the tone of his father&#39;s voice, but by
his father&#39;s straightened shoulders, by his piercing
glance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to tell you something!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin looked at his father a little eagerly. Perhaps
his father was going to give him a present, after all.
It would take only a quarter to buy the red tie. But
it was a very different announcement which William
had to make. He began with an alarming statement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After school closes you are to work at the furnace.
I let you do nothing too long already, Alvin!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At the furnace!&quot; Alvin&#39;s astonishment and
alarm made him cry out. He hated the sight of
Oliver Kuhns and Billy Knerr when they came
home all grimy and black.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
&quot;I will tell you something,&quot; said his father again.
&quot;Listen good, Alvin!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin needed no such command to make him
hearken. Alvin had not much will, but he was determining
with all his power that he would never, never
work in the furnace. He did not observe how his
father&#39;s cheeks had paled above his black beard,
and how steadily he kept his eyes upon his son. The
story William had to tell was not that of a man
whose mind was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know the church?&quot; said William.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean the Lutheran church where I used to go,
where my pop went.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You go in at the front of the church, but the
pulpit is at the other end. There were once long ago
two windows, one on each side of the pulpit. They
went almost down to the floor. From there the sun
shone in the people&#39;s eyes. You can&#39;t remember
that, Alvin. That was before your time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin sat still, sullenly. This conversation was,
after all, only of a piece with his father&#39;s strange
mutterings; it had to do with no red necktie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But now the Sunday School is there and those
windows are gone this long time. One is a door into
the Sunday School, the other is a wall. I built that
wall, Alvin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">William paused as though for some comment,
but Alvin said nothing.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
&quot;I was sitting where I am sitting now one evening
and she [his wife] was sitting where you are sitting
and you were running round, and the preacher
climbed the hill to us and he came in and he said to
me, &#39;William,&#39; he said, &#39;it is decided that the big
window is to be walled up. When can you do it?&#39;
That was the way he said it, Alvin. I said to him,
&#39;I can do it to-morrow. I had other work for the
afternoon at Zion Church, but I can put it off.&#39;
She could have told you that that was just what he
said and what I said. I was in the congregation and
there was at that time no other mason but me in
Millerstown. It was to be made all smooth, so that
nobody could ever tell there was a window there.
Then the preacher, he said to me,&mdash;she could tell
you that, too, if she were here,&mdash;he said, &#39;Come in
the morning and I will give you the key of the communion
cupboard,&#39; the little cupboard in the wall,
Alvin. There the communion set was kept. It was
silver, real silver, all shiny.&quot; William&#39;s hands began
to tremble and he moistened his dry lips. William
spoke of objects which were to him manifestly holy.
His son bent his head now, not idly and indifferently,
but stubbornly. He remembered the names which
the boys had shouted at his father; with all his soul
he recoiled from hearing his father&#39;s confession.
&quot;There was a silver pitcher, so high, and a silver
plate and a silver cup on a stem like a goblet. The
preacher put it away there and he locked the door
always.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
&quot;But he gave me the key and I went to my work.
I thought once I would have to open the door and
I stuck the key in the lock. It was a funny key.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I didn&#39;t need to open the door. I took
my dinner along&mdash;she could tell you that. But I
didn&#39;t need to open the door, and I took the key
out again and put it in my pocket, and when I
finished I swept everything up nice and locked the
church door and came down the pike. It was night
already and I went to the preacher and gave him the
two keys, the church key and the other, and got my
money. That quick he paid me, Alvin. He said to
me, &#39;Well, I guess you had a quiet day, William,&#39;
and I said, &#39;Yes, nobody looked in at me but a little
one.&#39; That is what I said to the preacher <i>then</i>, Alvin,
exactly that, but it was not true. But I thought it
was true.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I came home and I told her how nice and
smooth I had made it&mdash;to this day, you cannot see
it was a window there. Now, listen, Alvin!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sunset sky was darkening, a rising wind rattled
the door in its latch. The little house was lonely on
a winter night, even a bright night like this. The boy
began to be frightened, his father looked at him
with such dagger-like keenness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So it went for three weeks, Alvin, and then it
was Sunday morning and here I sat and there she
sat and you were running round, and it came a knock
at the door and there was the preacher. I was studying
my lesson for the Sunday School. It was about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
Ananias. I had learned the answers and the Golden
Text, but it was not yet time to go. I always went
to church; I liked to go to church. Then there came
this knocking, Alvin, and it was the preacher. I
thought perhaps he had come to give her the communion
while she wasn&#39;t very well and couldn&#39;t
go down through the snow. The preacher came in
and he looked at me.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;William,&#39; said the preacher to me, &#39;do you
remember how I gave you the key to the cupboard
when you fixed the wall?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Why, yes,&#39; I said. &#39;Of course!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;William,&#39; said he to me, &#39;did you open the cupboard?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Why, no,&#39; I said. &#39;I didn&#39;t have to, Para
[Pastor].&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Were you away from the church?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;No,&#39; I said. &#39;I took my dinner. She can tell you
that.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Why, William,&#39; said he to me, &#39;the communion
set is gone! The communion set is gone,&#39; he said,
&#39;gone!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I went with him to the church, Alvin, and I
looked into the cupboard. Everything was gone,
Alvin, bag and all. Then I came home and after a
while they came. They wanted to talk, they wanted
me to tell them everything that had happened all
day. But I couldn&#39;t tell them anything. I had built
the wall and a little one had talked to me, that was
all. There she sat and here I sat and it was dark.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
Then, Alvin, it came to me! When I got halfway
up the window, it was too high to go farther, and I
went out of the church to get boards and build a
platform across chairs so that I could reach. I was
gone some little time, and when I came back Hartman
was going down the pike. It was Hartman
that took the communion set.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin moved toward the side of his chair, and
away from his father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I got up and went down the hill, and into
Hartman&#39;s house I walked. He was sitting by the
table with his best clothes on to go to church and
she was there, too. They were always rich; they
had everything grand. I made tracks on her clean
floor, and she looked sharp at me, but I did not care.
I spoke right up to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;When I was building the wall in the church,&#39; I
said, &#39;I went out for a few boards. In that time you
were in the church and took the communion set.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He did not look at me, Alvin; he just sat there.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;What would I do with a communion set?&#39; he
said after a while to me.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I do not know what you would do with it,&#39; I
said back to him, &#39;but you have it. You took it.
God will punish you like Ananias.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then, Alvin&mdash;&quot; William laid a hand on his
son&#39;s shrinking arm. &quot;He went to the preacher, and
the preacher came to me and said I must be quiet.
That the preacher said to me! Then I went to
church and prayed out loud before all the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
that God would punish the wicked. I did not mention
any names, Alvin; I obeyed the preacher in
that! But God did not punish him. Everything
gets better and better for him all the time. Now, I
will punish him, Alvin, and you will help me. I have
paid a lot to detectives, but I have not yet enough.
He must be watched; we must have proof. I cannot
save so much any more because I have not so much
work. Now, if you work at the furnace you will make
a dollar a day. It will take all we can earn, Alvin,
<i>all</i>. I did without things that I need; I have saved
all I can, but I cannot save enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">William broke off suddenly. The room was quite
dark; where no light was needed, none was made in
William Koehler&#39;s house. William rose and went
stumbling about and lit the lamp, the lamp which
Katy saw gleaming against the dark side of the
mountain. In its light poor William gazed at his
son with yearning. He seemed now perfectly sane.</p>

<p class="indent">Then William spoke in a hollow, astonished
voice, the lamp rattling in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you believe he took it, Alvin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, no,&quot; stammered Alvin. &quot;What would he
want with it?&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br/>
ANOTHER CHRISTMAS DAY</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the Hartman house on Christmas Day there was
feasting, but no rejoicing. Cassie Hartman was fully
as able a cook as Grandmother Gaumer, and she
roasted as large a turkey and prepared almost as
many delicacies as Grandmother Gaumer and Bevy
Schnepp prepared for their great party. On the
kitchen settle were gifts, a gold breastpin set with a
handsome diamond, a heavy gold watch-chain, a
boy&#39;s suit, a gun, and a five-dollar gold-piece. There
were on them no affectionate inscriptions, no good
wishes. The breastpin was for Cassie, the watch-chain
for John Hartman, the other articles for David.
There were no gifts from outsiders&mdash;few Millerstonians
would have ventured to offer gifts to the
rich Hartmans. In the parlor windows hung holly
wreaths, the only bought wreaths in Millerstown.</p>

<p class="indent">The Hartmans had asked no guests to their feast.
John had long since separated himself from the
friends of his youth; as for Cassie, the thought of the
footprints of Christmas guests on her flag walk and
her carefully scrubbed porches would have made the
day even more uncomfortable than it was. Moreover,
one could not entertain Christmas company in
the kitchen, however fine that kitchen might be, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
in this wintry weather fires would have to be made
in the parlor and the dining-room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Company would track dust so for me,&quot; Cassie
would have said if any one had suggested that some
companions of his own age might do David good
and might not be a bad thing for his elders. &quot;When
you have fires, you have ashes, and I would then
have to clean my house in the middle of winter when
you cannot clean the carpets right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cassie Hartman was a beautiful woman, how
beautiful Millerstown, which set a higher value upon
mere prettiness than upon beauty, did not know.
Her figure was tall and full and she bore herself with
grace and dignity. Her face with its even features
and its full gray eyes was the face of an austere
saint, although her eyes, lifting when you addressed
her, seemed rather to hide her real character than
reveal it. But her character was austere and reserved,
of that you were sure.</p>

<p class="indent">If Cassie&#39;s soul was a consecrated one, the gods to
whom one would have assigned her worship were
Cleanliness and Order. The very progress of her
husband and son about the house annoyed her because
it was masculine and untidy. David knew
better than to enter the kitchen with muddy shoes,
but his father was not so careful; therefore both
trod upon an upper layer of slightly worn rag carpet,
superimposed upon the bright and immaculate
lower layer. In all other details but one of the
management of her house Cassie had her way. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
husband refused stubbornly to leave the great walnut
bed and the large room in which he slept for
a smaller room at the back of the house, as Cassie
wished, so that the great best bedrooms might be
garnished day and night with their proper spreads
and counterpanes and shams.</p>

<p class="indent">Each of Cassie&#39;s days and hours had its appointed
task. She could have told how her time would be
spent from now on until the last hour before her passing,
when the preacher would come in the proper
Lutheran fashion to give her the communion. The
Church required no such ceremony, but Cassie was
a formalist in religion and required it for herself.</p>

<p class="indent">So the three Hartmans ate alone in their broad
kitchen, John Hartman at one end of the table,
Cassie far away at the other, and David midway between
them. John Hartman&#39;s eyes were hardly
lifted above his food; he was an intolerably silent
person. Cassie&#39;s eyes roved everywhere, from her
stove, which she could scarcely wait to blacken,
toward her husband who ate carelessly, and toward
her son, who devoured his drumstick with due regard
for the clean cloth. The cloth was spotless and would
probably remain spotless, for an extra white cover
had been laid beneath the plates of John and David.
But to-morrow it would go into the tub, none the
less. It was too good to be used every day, and
it could not be put away bearing even the slight
wrinkles produced by unfolding. Cassie had no
more to say than her husband. There was really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
nothing for Cassie to say. Her mental processes
involved herself and her house, they responded to no
inspiration from without.</p>

<p class="indent">As for little David, he said nothing either. Katy
Gaumer had been right when she said that David was
a cross boy. David was cross and sullen. To-day,
however, he was only solemn. David was deeply
concerned about his sins. He was not only a sinner
in general, but he had sinned in a very particular
way, and he was unhappy. The turkey did not taste
as a Christmas turkey should, and his second slice of
mince-pie was bitter.</p>

<p class="indent">When John Hartman had eaten all he could, he
rose and put on his coat and went out to his great
barn to feed his stock. He went silently, as was his
wont.</p>

<p class="indent">When David had finished the last morsel of pie
which he was able to swallow, he, too, put on his hat
and went toward the door, moving silently and
slouchingly. There he stood and nervously kicked the
sill. His eyes, gray like his mother&#39;s, looked out from
under frowning, knitted brows; he thrust his hands
deep into his pockets and looked down at the floor.
This was Christmas Day; his parents had treated
him generously; he was convinced that he ought to
confess to them his great wickedness. He felt as
though he might cry, and as though crying, if he
had a shoulder to lean on, would be a soothing and
healing operation. The assault of Katy Gaumer had
sunk deep into his heart, as was natural since he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
thought of Katy night and day, since he saw her
wherever she went in her red dress, now scolding,
now laughing, and perpetually in motion. He had
fled to the attic of the schoolroom yesterday because
she had not spoken to him or looked at him, had even
passed him with her weight planted for an instant
heavily on his foot without even acknowledging his
presence. And to the attic she had followed him and
had there taunted and insulted him! She had no
business to say that he was cross and ugly; he would
be nice enough to her if she would return the compliment.
As for Grandmother Gaumer&#39;s cakes, he
had better cakes at home than Grandmother Gaumer
could bake!</p>

<p class="indent">David&#39;s heart was sore, and David was inexpressibly
lonely and miserable. He was now certain that
he would be happy if he could confess his sins to his
mother.</p>

<p class="indent">He forgot the last occasion of his appeal to her.
Then his finger had been cut, and he had been dizzy
and had seized hold of her, and the blood had fallen
down on her new silk dress. He forgot her reproof;
he remembered only that he needed some sort of
human tenderness. His father did not often speak
to him, but women were made, or should be made,
of different stuff from men. He had seen Susannah
Kuhns sit with her great Ollie upon her lap, and
Ollie was older than he was by a year. He had
heard Katy Gaumer, who had been so outrageously
cruel to him, cry over a sick kitten, and Katy was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
herself often rocked like a baby on Grandmother
Gaumer&#39;s knee.</p>

<p class="indent">David forgot now not only the cut finger, but
other repulses. He had no claim on Grandmother
Gaumer&#39;s embrace, and he would have hated to
have to sit on Susannah Kuhns&#39;s knee, but upon
this tall, beautiful person sitting by the table, he
had a claim. Moreover, her embraces would have
been pleasant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mom!&quot; said David.</p>

<p class="indent">Cassie&#39;s eyes were now on the dishes before her.
She liked to plan her mode of attack upon a piece of
work, and then proceed swiftly, keeping her mind
a blank to everything but the pleasure of seeing
order grow where disorder had been. Thus she liked
to go through her fine house, sweeping the rich
carpets, polishing the carved furniture, letting the
sunlight in only long enough to show each infamous
dust mote. Cassie was in the midst of such planning
now; she saw the dishes neatly piled, the hot suds
in the pan, her sleeves rolled above her elbows. She
did not answer David, did not even hear him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mom!&quot; said David again. He did not know now
exactly what he had meant to say. The necessity
for confession had dwindled to a necessity for the
sound of his mother&#39;s voice. It was dismal to live
in a house with companions who seemed deaf and
blind to one&#39;s existence. She <i>must</i> speak to him!</p>

<p class="indent">At the second call, Cassie looked at her son.
Cassie recognized dirt and disorder, but she did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
not recognize any need of the human soul. The needs
of her own soul had been, Cassie thought, cruelly
denied. At any rate, its power of perception had
failed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You stamp on that sill again and I&#39;ll have to
scrub it, David! To spoil things on Christmas!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cassie&#39;s voice contained no threat of punishment;
it was merely mildly exclamatory. The tone of it
was not vibrant but wooden. It might have been
rich and beautiful in youth; now it expressed no
emotion; it was flat, empty. She did not ask David
what he wanted, or why he addressed her; she did
not even wonder why he stopped in the doorway and
stared at her. She only frowned at him, until he
closed the door, himself outside. David had all the
clothes he could wear, all the food he could eat; he
had the finest house, the richest father and the most
capable mother in Millerstown; what more could he
wish to make him happy? His mother did not
speculate as to whether he was happy or not.</p>

<p class="indent">David crossed the yard in the freshly fallen snow
and slammed the gate behind him. Then he went
toward the mountain road, and started to climb,
passing the house of the Koehlers, where William sat
on one side of the stove and Alvin on the other, the
one muttering to himself, the other half asleep.
David kicked the snow as he walked, his head bent
lower and lower on his breast. He could see Katy
Gaumer like a sprite in her red dress with her flashing
eyes and her pointing finger; he could see her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
smiling at Alvin Koehler, whom he hated without
dreaming that in that son of a demented and dishonest
father Katy Gaumer could have any possible
interest.</p>

<p class="indent">As he started up the steepest part of the hill, he
began to talk aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want her!&quot; said poor little David. &quot;I want
Katy! I want Katy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Presently David left the road, and climbing over
the worm fence into the woodland, struck off diagonally
among the trees. Still far above him, at the
summit of the little mountain, there was a rough
pile of rocks which formed a tiny cairn or cave. Before
it was a small platform, parapeted by a great
boulder. Generations past had named the spot, without
any apparent reason, the &quot;Sheep Stable.&quot; It was
a favorite resort of David Hartman. Here, in secret,
far above Millerstown, he carried on the wicked
practices which he had meant to confess to his
mother. From the little plateau one could look for
miles and miles over a wide, rich, beautiful plain,
could see the church spires of a dozen villages, the
smoke curling upward from three or four great blast
furnaces, set in the midst of wide fields, and could
look far beyond the range of hills which bounded
the view of William Koehler on his lower level, to
another range. The Pennsylvania German made his
home only in fertile spots. When other settlers
passed the thickly forested lands because of the
great labor of felling the trees and preparing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
soil, he selected the sections bearing the tallest trees
and had as his own the fertile land forever.</p>

<p class="indent">David did not look out over the wide, pure expanse
upon which a few flakes were still falling and
beyond which the sun would soon sink gorgeously,
nor did he see the purple shadows under the pine
trees, nor observe the glancing motions of a squirrel,
watching him from a bough near by. He determined,
desperately, firmly, that he would repent no more;
he would now return to his evil ways and get from
them what satisfaction he could.</p>

<p class="indent">He crept on hands and knees into the little cave
and felt round under a mass of dried leaves until his
hands encountered the instruments of his evil practices.
Then David drew them forth, a stubby pipe,
which he had smoked once and which had made him
deathly ill, and a pack of cards, about whose mysterious
and delightful use he knew nothing. He sat
with them in his hands on the sloping rock, wishing,
poor little David, that he knew how to be wickeder
than he was!</p>

<p class="indent">Having fed his stock, John Hartman tramped for
a little while round his fields in the snow, then he
returned to the kitchen and sat down by the window
with a newspaper. Cassie lay asleep on the settle.
Custom forbade her working on Christmas Day, and
she never read, even the almanac. At her, her husband
looked once or twice inscrutably, then he laid
his head on the back of his tall chair and slept also.
It was a scene at which Katy Gaumer would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
pointed as proof of the unutterable stupidity of
Millerstown.</p>

<p class="indent">When her husband slept, Cassie opened her eyes
and looked at him with as steady a gaze as that which
he had bent upon her. Her mouth set itself in a firm,
straight line, her eyes deepened and darkened, her
hands, folded upon her breast, grasped her flesh.
Surely between these two was some great barrier of
offense, given or suffered, of strange, wounded pride,
or insufferable humiliation! Presently Cassie&#39;s lids
fell; she turned her cheek against the hard back of
the old settle and so fell asleep also.</p>

<p class="indent">John Hartman owned four farms and a great
stretch of woodland and a granite quarry on the far
side of the mountain and two farms and two peach
orchards and an apple orchard on this. A generation
ago a large deposit of fine iron ore had been discovered
upon a tract of land owned by his father.
The deposit was not confined to his fields, but extended
to the lands of his neighbors. But while they
sold ore and spent their money, John Hartman&#39;s
father, as shrewd a business man as his son, sold and
saved, and laid the foundation of his fortune. In a
few years the discovery of richer, more easily mined
deposits in the West and the cheap importation of
foreign ores made the Millerstown ore for the time
not worth the mining. Hartman the elder then covered
his mine breaches and planted timber, and the
growth set above the treasure underground was now
thick and valuable. John Hartman was also a director
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
in a county bank; he owned the finest, largest
house in Millerstown; he had a handsome and a
capable wife, and a son who was strong in body
and who had a good mind. Apparently his position
in life was secure, his comfort certain.</p>

<p class="indent">John Hartman, however, was neither comfortable
nor secure. The long-past accusations of a poor,
half-crazed workingman filled his waking hours
with apprehension and his nights with remorse.
Of William Koehler and his accusation John Hartman
was afraid, for William&#39;s accusation was, at
least in part, true.</p>

<p class="indent">John Hartman had been walking away from the
church on that bright November day years ago, when
his own David and Alvin Koehler were little children
and Katy Gaumer not much more than a baby.
He had upon him, as William had said, an air of
guilt; he had refused to reply to William&#39;s shouted
greeting; he was at that moment rapidly becoming,
if he was not already, what William called him, a
thief.</p>

<p class="indent">On that November day, a little while before William
had shouted at him, he had come down the
pike and had seen William leave the church to get
the boards for his platform, and had thereupon entered
the church with no other impulse than the
vague motions of a man sick at heart. A sin of his
earlier youth had risen suddenly from the grave
where he thought it buried, and now confronted him.
In his pocket lay an accusing, threatening letter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
written with pale ink upon poor paper in an ignorant
way. The amount of money which it demanded,
large as it was, did not trouble him, since he was already
possessor of his inheritance and growing daily
richer; it was the horror of the discovery of his sin.
Once cured of his obsession he had become a devout
man, had taken pleasure in the services of the church
of his fathers, attending all her meetings and contributing
to all her causes. He had married a good
woman from a neighboring village, who knew nothing
of the year he had spent away from Millerstown;
he had had a son; he was wholly happy.</p>

<p class="indent">He had gone during the latter part of the year
which he spent away from home, as a way of escaping
from himself, to Europe. He had been only a few
weeks ashore, but he had seen during that time civilizations
different from anything he had dreamed of.
He was most moved by great churches&mdash;he saw
Notre Dame of Amiens and Notre Dame of Paris&mdash;and
by the few great English estates of which he
caught glimpses in his rapid journey to Liverpool.
That was the way a man should live, planted in one
place, like a great oak tree, the center of a wide group&mdash;a
wife, children, dependents. He should have his
garden, his woodland, his great house, his stables,
his beautiful horses; he should pass the home place
on to a son who would perpetuate his name. With
such a home and with a worthy church to worship in,
a man could ask for nothing else in the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Repentant, healed, John Hartman had returned to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
Millerstown. There he had married and had built
his house, with great rooms at the front and smaller
rooms at the back for the servants who should make
his wife&#39;s life easy and dignified and should help to
care for the little brothers and sisters whom David
was to have. Cassie had had a hard youth; her
father had been a disgrace to his children; she was
quiet and stern and not hopeful, even though John
Hartman had lifted her to so high a place, of very
great happiness in this life. But Cassie&#39;s nature had
seemed to change in the glow of John Hartman&#39;s
affection and in the enjoyment of the luxuries with
which he surrounded her. She became less silent; she
met her husband at times with a voluntary caress,
which opened in his heart new springs of happiness.</p>

<p class="indent">But here, into this blessed peace and security, into
this great planning, fell, like a dangerous explosive,
the threatening letter. Almost beside himself with
fright, worn with three nights&#39; sleepless vigil, confused
with the numerous plans for ridding himself
of his persecutor which he made only to reject, and
aware that an immediate answer must be sent, John
Hartman approached the church where William
Koehler had been working.</p>

<p class="indent">The open door seemed to invite him to take refuge
within. He kept constantly touching the letter in his
pocket. He meant to destroy it, but it bore an address
which he dared not lose. He had been sitting
by the roadside on a fallen log, holding the letter
in his hand and writing absent-mindedly upon it.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
In the church he saw William&#39;s half-finished work
and the curious key in the little cupboard. As an
elder, he had a right to open the door and to take
out the beautiful silver vessels, the extravagance of
one generation which had become the pride of the
next. It seemed for an instant as though a touch
of the holy things might give him peace. Untying
the cord of the heavy bag as he laid it on top of
William&#39;s half-finished wall, he lifted out the silver
chalice.</p>

<p class="indent">But the sight of the beautiful vessel gave him no
relief, and the cool, smooth surface made him shiver.
He grasped it suddenly and involuntarily cried out,
&quot;Oh, what shall I do! What <i>shall</i> I do!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The grip of his hand was so strong that the cup
slipped from his fingers and striking the top of William&#39;s
wall, bounded into the dark aperture which
the building of the wall had made. He reached frantically
after it, and the gray bag, containing the
pitcher and paten, struck by his elbow, followed the
silver cup.</p>

<p class="indent">For an instant the accident drove the more serious
trouble from John Hartman&#39;s mind. He had great
reverence for the sacred vessels and he was afraid
that the fall had bruised their beautiful surfaces. He
tried to reach the bag, which lay uppermost, but it was
just beyond the tips of his fingers at the longest reach
of his arm. He would have to get William Koehler to
help him, much as he disliked to confess to such carelessness.
William would be shocked and horrified.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
Then, suddenly, John Hartman gave a sharp cry.
In his struggle to reach the gray bag, the letter had
dropped from his pocket. He had not put it back
into its envelope after his last anguished reading; he
could see it now as it lay spread out below him in the
darkness. His frantic eyes seemed to read each word
on the dim page. &quot;Your wife will know about it, and
your little boy and all the country.&quot; If he called
William to help him, William might read the letter.
Even if William made no actual effort to decipher
it, a single glance might reveal that some one was
threatening John Hartman.</p>

<p class="indent">He thought that he heard William coming through
the new Sunday School room and in panic, and without
stopping to reason beyond the swift conclusion
that if William&#39;s attention were not called to them,
he would not see the bag and the letter far down in
the narrow pit, he turned and locked the cupboard
door and went out the door of the church and down
the road. He did not reflect that William might
easily discover that the communion set was gone,
that he might accidentally drop his trowel into the
deep hole and in reaching it find the dreadful letter,
and that he might give an alarm, and all be lost; his
only thought was to get away.</p>

<p class="indent">He remembered dimly that he had brushed aside
a little child in his rush to the church door. When
he reached the door, he held himself back from running
by a mighty effort and walked slowly down the
pike, little Katy Gaumer toddling fearfully behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
him. It was easy to pretend that he did not hear
William call. Already he had planned how he would
restore the silver to its place. He knew that William
was engaged that afternoon to work at Zion Church;
therefore the wall would not be closed that day.</p>

<p class="indent">At night he would go to the church with a hoe or
rake and lift out the sacred vessels and the dreadful
letter, whose very proximity to them was sacrilege.
If the pitcher and the chalice and the plate had
suffered harm, he would explain that he had taken
them to the jeweler to be polished, and he would then
have them repaired.</p>

<p class="indent">But William postponed his work at Zion Church,
and that night, when John Hartman stole back to
replace the silver, the wall was finished and the
mortar set.</p>

<p class="indent">That night, also, John Hartman learned with absolute
certainty that his persecutor was dead, and
his persecution at an end.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They do not know that the communion set is
gone,&quot; thought he. &quot;To-morrow I will find a way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But in a sort of stupor, from which he roused himself
now and then to make wild and fruitless plans,
John Hartman let the days go by. The blow he had
received had affected him not only mentally, but
physically, and he was slow to recover from it, past
though the danger was. He went about his farms,
he looked earnestly upon his wife, he clasped his
little boy in his arms to assure himself that his two
treasures were real.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
But the more certain he became that the ghost of
the past was laid, the more terribly did the present
specter rise to harass him. Communion Sunday was
approaching, the loss of the communion service
would be discovered. There were moments when
the distracted man prayed for a miracle. He had
been delivered from that other terror by an act of
Providence which was almost a miracle; would he
not be similarly saved in a situation in which he was
innocent?</p>

<p class="indent">He thought of going at night and tearing the wall
down and restoring the service to its place, leaving
the strange vandalism a mystery to horrified Millerstown.
How happy he should be to pay for the rebuilding
of the wall! But the task was too difficult,
discovery too probable.</p>

<p class="indent">As the days passed, another way out of his trouble
occurred to him. He would go to William Koehler
and tell him all his misery. William was a good-natured,
quiet soul, who could be persuaded to silence,
or who might set a price upon silence, if silence
were a salable commodity. William could easily find
an excuse for doing his work over; it was well known
that he was foolishly particular. It never occurred
to John that suspicion of theft would probably fall
upon honest, simple William, who had had the key
of the cupboard and who had been the whole day
alone in the church. He got no farther than his own
terrible problem. He had dropped the silver into
the wall; both letter and silver were there convicting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
him; he must find a way to get them both out
and to put the silver in its place.</p>

<p class="indent">But he allowed day after day to pass and did not
visit William. William was, after all, only a day
laborer of the stupid family of Koehlers and John
was a property owner and an elder in the church; it
would be intolerably humiliating to make such a confession.
Communion Sunday was still two weeks
away; there would be time for him to make some
other plan.</p>

<p class="indent">When Communion Sunday morning came, John
had still no plan. Moving as in a trance, he went
with his wife to church, to find the congregation
gathered into wondering, distressed groups. The
door of the little cupboard was open, and beside it was
the smooth, newly painted wall. It was too late for
John to ask William Koehler for help in his difficulty.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not realize that all about him his fellow
church members were whispering about William;
he did not hear that William was accused, he was so
dazed by the fortunate complications of his own
situation. They did not dream of his agency! He
would replace the set with a much more beautiful
one. This generation would pass away long before
the wall would be taken down and then the letter
would be utterly destroyed by age or dampness. He
said to himself that God had been very good to him;
he even dared to thank Him during the confused,
uneasy service which the pastor conducted upon his
return from the house of William Koehler.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
And if William were accused, William had only
to deny that he had seen the communion service or
that he had even opened the door! He might, if
worse came to worst, let them search his house.
John wished patronizingly that he could give William
a little advice. He pitied William.</p>

<p class="indent">By night this pity had changed to hate. For like
the wildcats, whose leap from above he had feared
as a child when he walked the mountain road,
so William leaped upon him with his charge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You took it!&quot; insisted William. &quot;You stole the
communion set!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here was ruin, indeed! But Cassie thought the
man mad; she paid no attention to his frantic words;
she was concerned only about the state of her snow-tracked
floor. Hope leaped in the breast of John
Hartman. No living soul would believe such an
accusation against him!</p>

<p class="indent">When William had gone, John put on his coat
and went to the house of the preacher. He even
forced himself to use one of Millerstown&#39;s interesting
idioms, one of the last humorous expressions
of John Hartman&#39;s life.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;William Koehler came to me and accused me
of stealing the communion service,&quot; said he. &quot;There
is one rafter too few or too many in his little house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The preacher shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is something very wrong with poor William,&quot;
said he sorrowfully.</p>

<p class="indent">With a firm step John Hartman returned to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
house. When it was time for the evening service he
went to church as was his custom.</p>

<p class="indent">John Hartman&#39;s bank account increased steadily;
he added field to field and orchard to orchard. His
great safe in the dining-room held papers of greater
and greater value; his great Swiss barns with their
deep forebays and their mammoth haylofts were
enlarged; his orchards bent under their weight of
fruit. But John Hartman did not say to his soul,
&quot;Take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.&quot; With
his soul poor John held a different sort of converse.</p>

<p class="indent">Desperately he tried to fix his mind upon his
many affairs, so that he might shut out the recollection
of William Koehler and the sound of his mad
voice. He was afraid for a long time that he, John
Hartman, might rise suddenly in church and make
rash confession, or that he might point out to his
fellow directors in the bank the black-bearded,
sharp-eyed face, which he saw looking at him over
their shoulders, or that he might shout out upon
the street his secret.</p>

<p class="indent">Gradually he succeeded in thinking only of his
work. The sudden appearance of William Koehler
gave him a strange trembling of the limbs and an
oppression about the heart, that was all. William
made no further accusation for a long time, and
encounters could be avoided. Long before William
had begun to pray aloud, dropping down in front
of the post-office or at a street corner, Millerstown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
had become certain that he was crazy. His unintelligible
prayers betrayed nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">But, slowly, as his mind turned itself a little from
its own wretchedness, poor Hartman became aware
of an enemy in his own household. To his caresses
his wife ceased to respond; she had become once
more the silent, cold woman of their earliest married
life, whom he had chosen because she and the
woman who had victimized him were as far apart
as the poles in character and disposition. At first
poor Hartman thought that she felt his neglect of
her during the weeks of his misery; he tried now to
be all the more tender and affectionate. If he could
only find here a refuge, if he could only lay before
her his wretched state! But confession to Cassie
was impossible; one had only to look upon her to
see that!</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Hartman decided that she believed
William&#39;s accusation, and he became enraged with
her because she would believe that to which no one
else in Millerstown would give an instant&#39;s credence.
&quot;Let her believe!&quot; said he then in his despair.
She became in his mind a partner of William against
him. Let each do his worst; they could convict him
of nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">In reality it was Hartman&#39;s earlier sin which was
no more his secret. He had delayed too long in
answering the demand for money and a letter had
been written to Cassie also, and Cassie had hardened
her heart against him, hardened her heart even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
against her child. Cassie had had a sad life; her
heart was only a little softened as yet by her happiness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will not care,&quot; cried poor Cassie. &quot;I will henceforth
set my heart on nothing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cassie was a woman of mighty will; her youth had
trained her to strength. When her child climbed her
knee, she put him away from her; when she remembered
John Hartman&#39;s hopes for the occupation of
the many rooms he had built in his house, she shook
her head with a deep, choking, indrawn breath. It
could never, never be!</p>

<p class="indent">But the human heart must have some object for
its care or it will cease to beat. Upon her possessions,
her house, her carpets, her furniture, Cassie
set now her affection. These inanimate things had
no power to deceive, to betray, to torture. Gradually
they became so precious that her great rooms
were like shrines, into which she went but seldom,
but to which her heart turned as she sat alone by
her kitchen window with her sewing or lay awake
by her husband&#39;s side in the great wonderfully bedecked
walnut bed which, to her thinking, human
use profaned.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, in the same house, eating at the same table,
sitting side by side in church, watching their son
grow into a young manhood which was as silent as
their middle age, the guilty man and the unforgiving
woman had lived side by side for almost fifteen
years this Christmas Day. John Hartman had built
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
no great church, rising like a cathedral on the hillside.
He had not even presented the church with a
communion service, being afraid of rousing suspicion.
He had gathered great store for himself&mdash;an
object in life toward which he had never aimed.</p>

<p class="indent">Millerstown suspected nothing, neither of the sin
of John Hartman&#39;s youth, nor of his strange connection
with the disappearance of the communion
service, nor of poor Cassie&#39;s aching, hardening heart.
Millerstown, like the rest of the world, accepted
people as they were; it did not seek for excuses or
explanations or springs of action. John Hartman
was a silent and taciturn man&mdash;few persons remembered
that he had been otherwise. Cassie was
so unpleasantly particular about her belongings that
she would not invite her neighbors to quiltings and
apple-butter boilings, and so inhumanly unsocial
that she would not attend those functions at other
houses. There was an end of the Hartmans.</p>

<p class="indent">Gradually a second change came over John Hartman.
His horror of discovery became a horror of
his sin; he was bowed with grief and remorse.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has gone crazy over it!&quot; he lamented. &quot;William
Koehler has gone crazy over it. I wish&quot;&mdash;poor
Hartman spoke with agony&mdash;&quot;I wish he had proved
it against me. Then it would all have been over
long ago!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When William Koehler&#39;s wife died, John Hartman
struggled terribly with himself, but could not bring
himself to make confession. From an upper window
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
he watched the little cortège leave the house on the
hill; he saw William lift his little boy into the carriage;
he saw the cortège disappear in the whirling
snow. But still he was silent.</p>

<p class="indent">When William in his insanity mortgaged his little
house in order to pay dishonest and thieving men
to watch John Hartman, John Hartman secured the
mortgage and treasured it against the time when he
would prove to William that he had tried to do well
by him. John Hartman also bought other mortgages.
When Oliver Kuhns, the elder, squandered
his little inheritance in the only spree of his life,
John Hartman helped him to keep the whole matter
from Millerstown and restored to him his house.
When one of the Fackenthals, yielding to a mad impulse
to speculate, used the money of the school
board and lost it, John Hartman gave him the
money in secret. Proud Emma Loos never knew that
her husband had wasted her little patrimony before
he died. Sarah Benner never discovered that for
days threat of prison hung over her son and that
John Hartman helped him to make good what he
had stolen.</p>

<p class="indent">But John Hartman&#39;s benefactions did not ease his
soul. He came to see clearly that he must have
peace of mind or he would die. He no longer thought
of the disgrace to his wife and son; his thoughts
had been for so long fixed upon himself that he could
put himself in the place of no one else.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-morrow I will make this right,&quot; he would
say, and forever, &quot;To-morrow, to-morrow!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
But the years passed and William Koehler grew
more mad and John Hartman more rich and more
silent, and the silver service lay deep in the pit
between the church and the Sunday School. The
little building was solid, it was amply large, it would
serve many generations. Katy Gaumer, brushed
out of his path by John Hartman as he sought the
door that November day, recalled nothing of the
incident except that her childish dignity had been
wounded. It was Katy herself who said that nothing
ever happened in Millerstown!</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the beating of John Hartman&#39;s pulse
quickened; it became difficult for him to draw a
long, free, comfortable breath. Dr. Benner, whom
he consulted, said that he must eat less and must
walk more. John Hartman said to himself that now,
before another day passed, he would go to the little
house on the mountain-side and begin to set right
the awful wrong of his youth. But still he planned
to go to-morrow instead of to-day. Finally, one
afternoon in May, he had his horse put into the
buggy and drove slowly up the mountain road.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br/>
THE MILLERSTOWN SCHOOL</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> 24th of December, with its great Christmas
entertainment, had closed a term of average accomplishment
in the Millerstown school. Alvin
Koehler and David Hartman, who composed the
highest class, had been, the one as idle, the other
as sullen, as usual. The children had learned about
as much as the Millerstown children were accustomed
to learn in an equal time, they had been reprimanded
about as often. The teacher had roared
at them with the vehemence usually required for
the management of such young savages as Coonie
Schnable and Ollie Kuhns and Katy Gaumer.
Katy, in the second class, had not nearly enough to
keep her busy; there remained on her hands too
many moments to be devoted to the invention of
mischief.</p>

<p class="indent">But now, suddenly, began a new era in the Millerstown
school. Mr. Carpenter, recovering at happy
ease in his home in a neighboring village from the
strain put upon him by the stupidity and impertinence
and laziness of his pupils, was to be further
irritated and annoyed.</p>

<p class="indent">School opened on New Year&#39;s morning, and Mr.
Carpenter rose a little late from his comfortable bed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
at Sarah Ann Mohr&#39;s and ate hurriedly his breakfast
of delicious panhaas and smoked sausage. Haste
at meals always tried the sybarite soul of Mr. Carpenter.
He was cross because he had to get up; he
was cross because he had to teach school; he was
cross at Sarah Ann because she urged him to further
speed. Sarah Ann always mothered and grandmothered
the teacher.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will come late, teacher. You will have to
hurry yourself. It is not a good thing to be late on
New Year&#39;s already, teacher. New Year,&quot;&mdash;went
on Sarah Ann in her provokingly placid way,&mdash;&quot;New
Year should be always a fresh start in our
lives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Carpenter slammed the kitchen door; he
would have liked to be one of his own scholars for
the moment and to have turned and made a face
at Sarah Ann. He was not interested in fresh starts.
Taking his own deliberate, comfortable time, he
started out the pike.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, suddenly, the clear, sweet notes of the
schoolhouse bell, whose rope it was his high office
to pull, astonished the ears of the teacher. It was
one of the impertinent boys,&mdash;Ollie Kuhns, in
all probability,&mdash;who thus dared to reprove his
master.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will give a good thrashing for that one, whoever
he is,&quot; Mr. Carpenter promised himself. &quot;He
will begin the New Year fine. He will ache on the
New Year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
But the bell rang slowly, its stroke was not such
as the arm of a strong boy could produce. Indeed,
Mr. Carpenter never allowed the boys to ring the
bell, because there responded at once to the sound
the whole of alarmed Millerstown seeking to rescue
its children from fire. The bell had, moreover,
to Mr. Carpenter&#39;s puzzled ears, a solemn tone, as
though it portended things of moment. Faster Mr.
Carpenter moved along, past the Squire&#39;s where
Whiskey barked at him, and he hissed a little at
Whiskey; past Grandfather Gaumer&#39;s, where he
thought of Grandfather&#39;s Katy and her ways with
bitter disapproval, to the open spaces of the pike.</p>

<p class="indent">The bell still rang solemnly, as Mr. Carpenter
hurried across the yard and up the steps.</p>

<p class="indent">In the vestibule of the schoolhouse, he stood
still, dumb, paralyzed. The ringer of the bell, the
inventor of woe still unsuspected by Mr. Carpenter,
stood before him. During the Christmas holiday,
Katy&#39;s best dress had become her everyday dress;
its red was redder than Katy&#39;s cheeks, brighter than
her eyes; it had upon her teacher the well-known
effect of that brilliant color upon certain temperaments.
Mr. Carpenter&#39;s cheeks began to match
it in hue; he opened his lips several times to speak,
but was unable to bring forth a sound.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy gave the rope another long, deliberate pull,
then she eased her arms by letting them drop
heavily to her sides. From within the schoolroom
the children, even Ollie Kuhns, watched in admiration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
and awe. Katy was always independent, always
impertinent, but she had never before dared to usurp
the teacher&#39;s place.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say!&quot; Thus in a terrible voice did Mr. Carpenter
finally succeed in addressing his pupil. &quot;Who
told you you had the dare to ring this bell?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To this question Katy returned no answer. With
eased arms she brushed vigorously until she had
removed the lint which had gathered on her dress,
then she walked into the schoolroom, denuded now
of its greens and flags and reduced to the dullness
of every day. Her teacher continued his admonitions
as he followed her up the aisle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess you think you are very smart, Katy.
Well, you are not smart, that is what you are not.
I would give you a good whipping if I did right, that
is what I would do. I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To the amazement of her school-fellows, Katy,
after lingering a moment at her desk, followed Mr.
Carpenter to the front of the room. She still made
no answer, she only approached him solemnly. Was
she going, of her own accord, to deliver herself up to
punishment? Mr. Carpenter&#39;s heavy rod had never
dared to touch the shoulders of Katy Gaumer, whose
whole &quot;Freundschaft&quot; was on the school board.</p>

<p class="indent">The Millerstown school ceased speculating and
gave itself to observation. Upon the teacher&#39;s desk,
Katy laid, one by one, three books and a pamphlet.
Then Katy spoke, and the sound of the school bell,
solemn as it had been, was not half so ominous, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
filled with alarming import as Katy&#39;s words. She
stood beside the desk, she offered first one book to
the master, then another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here is a algebray,&quot; explained Katy; &quot;here is a
geometry, here is a Latin book. Here is a catalogue
that tells about these things. I am going to college;
I must know many things that I never yet heard
of in this world. And you&quot;&mdash;announced Katy&mdash;&quot;you
are to learn me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What!&quot; cried Mr. Carpenter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry for all the bad things I did already
in this school.&quot; The Millerstown children quivered
with excitement; on the last seat Ollie Kuhns pretended
to fall headlong into the aisle. Alvin Koehler
looked up with mild interest from his desk which
he had been idly contemplating, and David Hartman
blushed scarlet. Poor David&#39;s pipe had not yet
cured him of love. &quot;I will do better from now on,&quot;
promised Katy. &quot;And you&quot;&mdash;again this ominous
refrain&mdash;&quot;you are to learn me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot study those things!&quot; cried Mr. Carpenter
in triumph. &quot;You are not even in the first
class!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will move to the first class,&quot; announced Katy.
&quot;This week I have studied all the first class spelling.
You cannot catch me on a single word. I can spell
them in syllables and not in syllables. I can say <i>l</i>,
<i>l</i>, or double <i>l</i>. I can say them backwards. I have
worked also all the examples in the first class arithmetic.
The squire&quot;&mdash;thus did Katy dangle the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
chains of Mr. Carpenter&#39;s servitude before his disgusted
eyes&mdash;&quot;the squire, he heard me the spelling,
and the doctor, he looked at my examples. They
were all right. It will not be long before I catch up
with those two in the first class.&quot; Katy flushed a
deeper red. Over and over she said to herself, &quot;I
shall be in the first class with Alvin, I shall be in the
first class with Alvin!&quot; Her knees began suddenly
to tremble and she started back to her desk, scarcely
knowing which way she went.</p>

<p class="indent">As she passed down the aisle, she felt upon her
David Hartman&#39;s glance. He sat in the last row,
his head down between his shoulders. As Katy
drew near, his gaze dropped to the hem of her red
dress. David&#39;s heart thumped; it seemed to him
that every one in the school must see that he was
in love with Katy Gaumer. He hated himself for
it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you want me in your class, David?&quot;
asked Katy foolishly and flippantly. Katy spoke
a dozen times before she thought once.</p>

<p class="indent">David looked up at her, then he looked down. His
eyes smarted; he was terrified lest he cry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have one dumb one in my class already,&quot; said
he. &quot;I guess I can stand another.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy dropped into her seat with a slam. The
teacher&#39;s hand was poised above the bell which
called the school to order, and for Katy, at least,
there was to be no more ignoring of times and
seasons.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
&quot;Dumb?&quot; repeated Katy. &quot;You will see who is
the dumb one!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With the loud ringing of the teacher&#39;s bell a new
order began in the Millerstown school. Its first
manifestation was beneficent, rather than otherwise.
It became apparent that with Katy Gaumer
orderly, the school was orderly. The morning passed
and then the afternoon without a pause in its busy
labors. No one was whipped, no one was sent to the
corner, no one was even reproved. A studious Katy
seemed to set an example to the school; a respectful
Katy seemed to establish an atmosphere of
respect. Mr. Carpenter was wholly pleased.</p>

<p class="indent">But Mr. Carpenter&#39;s pleasure did not last. Mr.
Carpenter became swiftly aware of a worse condition
than that of the past. Mr. Carpenter had been
lifted from the frying-pan and laid upon the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">To her teacher&#39;s dismay, Katy came early in the
morning to ask questions; she stayed in the schoolroom
at recess to ask questions; sometimes, indeed,
she visited her afflicted teacher in the evenings to
ask questions. Katy enjoyed visiting him in the
evenings, because then Sarah Ann Mohr, sitting on
the other side of the table, her delectable Millerstown
&quot;Star&quot; forgotten, her sewing in her lap, her
lips parted, burned before her favorite the incense
of speechless admiration. Poor Mr. Carpenter grew
thin and white, and his little mustache drooped as
though all hope had gone from him. Mr. Carpenter
learned to his bitter sorrow that algebra and geometry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
were no idle threats, and Mr. Carpenter, who
had put his normal school learning, as he thought,
forever behind him, had to go painfully in search of
it. The squire was Katy&#39;s uncle, the doctor was her
cousin; they were all on Katy&#39;s side; they helped
her with her lessons; they encouraged her in this
morbid and unhealthy desire for learning, and the
teacher did not dare to refuse her. The difficulties
of the civil service examination appalled him; he
could never pass; he must at all costs keep the
Millerstown school.</p>

<p class="indent">Occasionally, as of old, Katy corrected him, but
now her corrections were involuntary and were immediately
apologized for.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must not say &#39;craddle&#39;; you must say
&#39;crawl&#39; or &#39;creep,&#39;&quot; directed Katy. &quot;Ach, I am
sorry! I did not mean to say that! But how&quot;&mdash;this
with desperate appeal&mdash;&quot;how can I learn if
you do not make it right?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes Katy threatened poor Mr. Carpenter
with Greek; then Mr. Carpenter would have
welcomed the Socratic cup.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My patience is all,&quot; he groaned. &quot;Do they take
me for a dictionary? Do they think I am a encyclopædia?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still, through the long winter Katy&#39;s relatives
continued to spoil her. In Millerstown there has
never been any objection to educating women
simply because they are women. The Millerstown
woman has always had exactly what she wanted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
The normal schools and high schools in Pennsylvania
German sections have always had more women
students than men. If Katy wanted an education,
she should have it; indeed, in the sudden
Gaumer madness, Katy should have had the moon
if she had asked for it and if her friends could have
got it for her. Her grandfather and grandmother
talked about her as they sat together in the evenings
while Katy was extracting knowledge from the
squire or from the doctor or from Mr. Carpenter,
never dreaming that they were rapidly ruining the
Benjamin of their old age. They had trained many
children, and the squire had admonished all Millerstown,
but Katy was never admonished by any of
them. They liked her bright speech, they liked her
ambition, they allowed themselves the luxury of
indulging her in everything she wanted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is that smart!&quot; Bevy Schnepp expressed
the opinion of all Katy&#39;s kin. &quot;When she is high
gelernt [learned], she will speak in many woices
[tongues].&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Of all her relatives none spoiled Katy quite so
recklessly as young Dr. Benner. There was not
enough practice in healthy Millerstown to keep him
busy, and Katy amused and entertained him. He
liked to take her about with him in his buggy; he
liked to give her hard problems, and to see to what
lengths of memorizing she could go. Dr. Benner
had theories about the education of children and he
expounded them with the cheerful conceit of bachelors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
and maiden ladies. Dr. Benner, indeed, had
theories about everything. It was absurd, to Dr.
Benner&#39;s thinking, ever to restrain a healthy child
from learning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let &#39;em absorb,&quot; said he. &quot;They won&#39;t take
more than is good for &#39;em.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dr. Benner was nearly enough related to Katy to
be called a cousin, yet far enough removed to be
stirred into something like jealousy at Katy&#39;s enthusiastic
defense of the Koehlers. Katy should have
no youthful entanglement&mdash;Dr. Benner remembered
his own early development and flushed shamefacedly&mdash;to
prevent her from growing into the
remarkable person she might become. Dr. Benner
decided that she must be got away from Millerstown
as soon as possible; she had been already too much
influenced by its German ways. Katy was meant
for higher things. For a while young Dr. Benner
felt that, pruned and polished, Katy was meant
for him!</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, Katy was to be saved from further
contamination by being kept constantly busy. It
pleased him to see her devoted to algebra, and he
was constantly suggesting new departures in learning
to her aspiring mind. It was unfortunate that
each new suggestion included a compliment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe you could sing, Katy,&quot; said he, one
March day, as, with Katy beside him, he drove
slowly down the mountain road.</p>

<p class="indent">The landscape lay before them, wide, lovely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
smiling, full of color in the clear sunshine. Far away
a bright spot showed where the sun was reflected
from the spires and roofs of the county seat; here
and there the blast furnaces lifted the smoky banner
of prosperous times.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy&#39;s cheeks were red, her dark hair blew across
her forehead; it was with difficulty that she sat still
beside the doctor. Spring was coming, life was
coming.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sing?&quot; said Katy, &quot;I sing? I would like that
better than anything I can think of in this world. I
would rather be a singer than a missionary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was really nothing in the world that Katy
would not have liked to do, except to stay in Millerstown
and be inconspicuous; there was nothing in
the world which she questioned her ultimate ability
to do.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor chuckled at Katy&#39;s comparison, which
Katy had not intended to be funny.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A classmate of mine is coming to see me next
week. He teaches singing, and I&#39;m going to get him
to hear your voice. Won&#39;t that be fine, Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everything is fine,&quot; answered Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor&#39;s classmate arrived; for him Katy
<i>oh&#39;d</i> and <i>ah&#39;d</i> through an astonishingly wide range.
The young man was enthusiastic over her vocal possibilities.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he says you mustn&#39;t take lessons for another
year,&quot; said Dr. Benner.</p>

<p class="indent">Again he and Katy were driving down the mountain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
road. They had climbed this afternoon to the
Sheep Stable, and from there had gazed at the glorious
prospect and had counted through a glass the
scattered villages and the church spires in the
county seat.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy&#39;s blood tingled in her veins. She had never
dreamed that she could <i>sing</i>! She had never seen
a picture which was painted by hand or she would
now have been certain that she could become a great
artist. She determined that some day she would
return to the Sheep Stable alone and there sing for
her own satisfaction. She had not sung her best for
the doctor&#39;s friend down in grandmother&#39;s parlor,
her best meaning her loudest. At the Sheep Stable
there would be no walls to confine the great sounds
she would produce.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will sing so that they hear me at Allentown,&quot;
she planned. &quot;I have no time now, but when I have
time I will go once. It is so nice not to be dumb,&quot;
finished Katy with great satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent">The winter passed like a dream. Presently an interesting
change came about in the Millerstown
school and in its teacher. Perhaps Mr. Carpenter
was mortified, as well as driven into it, but there
sprang up somehow in his soul a decent, honest ambition.
Delving painfully after forgotten knowledge,
he studied to some purpose, and it began to seem
as though even civil service questions might become
easy and Mr. Carpenter pass his examinations at
last. For the first few weeks of the new régime, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
was able to keep only a lesson or two ahead of his
pupils, but, little by little, that space widened. As
if in pure spite, Mr. Carpenter learned his lessons.
Then he assumed a superior and taunting air. Katy
at the Christmas entertainment had looked at him
with no more disgust than his face now expressed
when his pupils gave wrong answers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Gelt regiert die Welt, und Dummheit Millerstown&#39;&quot;
(Gold rules the world and stupidity Millerstown)!
Thus Mr. Carpenter adapted a familiar
proverb in comment upon mistakes which he himself
would have made a month ago.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Carpenter&#39;s pupils followed him steadily.
David Hartman was more mature than the others
and kept without difficulty at their head. As for
Katy, with the help which Katy had out of school
hours, even a dull child might have done well. It
was help which was not unsuspected by David, but
David held his tongue. David felt a fierce, unwilling
pride in Katy&#39;s spirit.</p>

<p class="indent">But there was another sort of help being given and
received which David resented jealously and indignantly,
hardly believing the evidence of his own
ears and eyes. David had taken some pleasure in
the winter&#39;s work. He sat daily beside Katy in class;
it was not possible for her to be always rude and
curt. David was also puzzled and moved by a
change in his father. He often met his father&#39;s
glance when he lifted his own eyes suddenly, and
it seemed to him that his father had come to realize
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
his existence. His heart softened; he was pathetically
quick to respond to signs of affection. It seemed
to him that each day brought with it the possibility
of some new, extraordinary happening. Several
times he was on the point of putting his arm about
his father&#39;s shoulders as he sat with his paper. Without
being conscious of it, John Hartman showed
outwardly the signs of the inward struggle. Never
had his yearning, repressed love for the boy so tortured
him, never had it demanded so insistently an
outward expression. But he repressed himself a
little longer. When he should have made all right
with William Koehler, then would he yield to the
impulses of fatherhood. That bound poor Hartman
had set himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy remembered all her life, even if Alvin Koehler
did not, the day on which Alvin set to work with
diligence. He often looked at her curiously, as if he
could not understand her. But Alvin gave earnest
thought only to himself, to his hopeless situation
with a half-mad and dishonest father and the dismal
prospect of working in the furnace. His father
seemed to be becoming more wild. There were times
when Alvin feared violence at his hands. He talked
to himself all day long, making frequent mention of
John Hartman. Sometimes Alvin thought vaguely
of warning the squire or John Hartman himself
about his father. He believed less and less his father&#39;s
crazy story.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes Alvin stared at Katy and blinked like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
an owl in his effort to account for her alternate
shyness and kindness. Alvin was not accustomed
to being treated kindly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what will you do when you are educated?&quot;
he inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What will I do?&quot; repeated Katy, her heart
thumping as it always did when Alvin spoke to her.
&quot;I will teach and I will earn a great deal of money
and travel over the whole world and buy me souvenirs.
And I will sing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was very pleasant to tell Alvin of her prospects.
Perhaps he would walk home with her from church
on Sunday. Then how Essie Hill, in spite of all her
outward piety, would hate her! The secret of mild
Essie&#39;s soul was not a secret from Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you teach in a school like Millerstown?&quot;
asked Alvin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Millerstown! Never! It would have to be a bigger
school than Millerstown.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin looked up at Mr. Carpenter. It was recess
and Mr. Carpenter was hearing a spelling class which
had not learned its lesson for the morning recitation.
Mr. Carpenter did not appear at his best, judged
by the usually accepted standards of etiquette; he
leaned back lazily in his chair, his feet propped on
his desk, his hands clasped above his head; but to
Alvin there was nothing inelegant in his attitude.
Mr. Carpenter was an enviable person; he never
needed to soil his hands or to have a grimy face or
to carry a dinner pail.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
&quot;Teaching would be nice work,&quot; said Alvin
drearily. &quot;But I can never learn this Latin. I am
all the time getting farther behind. It gets every
day worse and worse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but you can learn it!&quot; cried Katy, her face
aglow. If he would only, only, let her help! &quot;I will
show you. Here are my sentences for to-day. The
doctor went over them and he says they are all
right.&quot; And blushing, with her heart pounding
more than ever, Katy returned to her seat.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a difficult sentence in that day&#39;s
lesson, a sentence over which David Hartman had
puzzled and on which he failed. Then the teacher
called on Alvin, simply as a matter of form. The
school had begun to giggle a little when they heard
his name. But now up he rose, the dull, the stupid,
the ordinary, and read the sentence perfectly! At
him David Hartman stared with scarlet face. He
expected that the teacher would rise and annihilate
Alvin, but the teacher passed to the next sentence.
Mr. Carpenter was at the present time angry at
David; he was rather glad he was discomfited.
Such was the nature of Mr. Carpenter!</p>

<p class="indent">To Alvin David said nothing, but upon the
shoulder of Katy Gaumer, putting on her cloak
in the cupboard after school, David laid a heavy
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You helped Alvin!&quot; David&#39;s hand quivered
with astonishment and anger and from the touch
of Katy&#39;s shoulder. &quot;It is cheating. Some day I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
am going to catch you at it before the whole
school.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before she could answer, if she could have made
answer at all, David was gone. She hated him;
she would help Alvin all she liked until he had
caught up, and afterwards, too, if she pleased. Alvin
had had no chance, and David had everything, a
rich father, fine clothes and money. It was perfectly
fair for her to help Alvin. She hated all the Hartmans.
She was furiously angry and it hurt to be
angry. It did not occur to her to be ashamed of
Alvin who would accept a girl&#39;s translation. With
a whirl and a flirting of her skirts, Katy sailed
through the door and down the pike.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will sit in Millerstown!&quot; she declared to the
empty air. &quot;But I am going away! Nothing ever
happens in Millerstown. Millerstown is nothing
worth!&quot; Then Katy stood still, dizzy with all the
glorious prospect of life. &quot;I am going away! I am
going away!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br/>
THE BEE CURE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">January</span> and March and April passed, and still
Mr. Carpenter and his pupils studied diligently.
David Hartman did not carry out his threat to expose
Katy; such a course would have been impossible.
Day after day it seemed more certain that his father
was about to say to him some extraordinary thing.
He saw his father helping himself out of his buggy
with a hand on the dashboard; he saw that hand
tremble. But his father still said nothing. That
May day when John Hartman would at last begin
to right the wrong he had done had not yet arrived.</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of all Katy&#39;s efforts she could not pass
above David in school. Alvin Koehler needed less
and less help, now that he was convinced that
through learning lay the way to ease and comfort,
to the luxurious possession of several suits of clothes,
to a seat upon a platform. Mr. Carpenter would
never have to do hard work; Alvin determined to
model his life after that of his teacher. He scarcely
spoke to his father now, and he grew more and more
afraid of him.</p>

<p class="indent">In May the Millerstown school broke its fine
record for diligence and steady attendance. The
trees were in leaf, the air was sweet, the sky was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
dimmed by a soft haze, as though the creating earth
smoked visibly. Locust blooms filled the air with
their wine-like perfume, flowers starred the meadows.
Grandmother Gaumer&#39;s garden inside its stone wall
was so thickly set with hyacinths and tulips and
narcissus that one wondered where summer flowers
would find a place. Daily Katy gathered armfuls of
purple flags and long sprays of flowering currant
and stiff branches of japonica and bestowed them
upon all who asked. Katy learned her lessons in the
garden and planned for the future in the garden and
thought of Alvin in the garden.</p>

<p class="indent">One day, unrest came suddenly upon the Millerstown
boys; imprisonment within four walls was intolerable.
Even Katy, yearning for an education,
was affected by the warmth of the first real summer
day, and Alvin Koehler wished for once that he had
learned to swim, so that he could go with the other
boys to bathe in Weygandt&#39;s dam. Alvin had not
yet bought the red necktie; money was more scarce
than ever this spring. Alvin&#39;s whole soul demanded
clothes. He reflected upon the impression he had
made upon Katy Gaumer; he observed the blush
which reddened the smooth cheek of Essie Hill at
his approach; he was increasingly certain that his
was an unusual and attractive personality.</p>

<p class="indent">All through the long May afternoon, Katy studied
with great effort, wishing that she, too, had played
truant, and had climbed to the Sheep Stable as she
had long planned, there to discover the full volume
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
of her voice. She looked across at Alvin, but Alvin
did not look back.</p>

<p class="indent">All the long afternoon Alvin gazed idly at his
algebra, and all the long afternoon David Hartman
and Jimmie Weygandt and Ollie Kuhns and the two
Fackenthals and Billy Knerr and Coonie Schnable
braved the wrath of Mr. Carpenter and played truant.
First they traveled to the top of the mountain,
then raced each other down over rock and fallen
tree; and then, hot and tired, plunged into Weygandt&#39;s
dam, which was fed by a cold stream from
the mountain. When the water grew unendurable,
they came out to the bank, rubbed themselves to
a glow with their shirts, and hanging the shirts
on bushes to dry, plunged back with shouts and
splashing.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Carpenter did not greatly regret their absence.
Upon him, too, spring fever had descended;
he was too lazy to hear thoroughly the lessons of the
pupils who remained. When the lowest class droned
its &quot;ten times ten iss a hundred,&quot; Mr. Carpenter
was nodding; when they sang out in drowsy mischief,
&quot;&#39;laven times &#39;laven iss a hundred and &#39;laven,&quot;
Mr. Carpenter was asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Carpenter planned no immediate punishment
for his insubordinate pupils. The threat that
he would tell their parents would be a powerful and
valuable weapon in his hands for the rest of the
term. The Millerstown parents had fixed theories
about the heinousness of truancy.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
But though Mr. Carpenter planned no punishment,
punishment was meted out.</p>

<p class="indent">The stroke of the gods was curiously manifested.
The next morning the disobedient seven ate their
breakfasts in their several homes, in apparently
normal health, unless a sudden frown or twist of lip
or an outburst of bad temper might be said to constitute
symptoms of disorder. One or two clung
closely to the kitchen stove, though the day was
even warmer than yesterday, and David Hartman
visited surreptitiously the cupboard in which his
mother kept the cough medicine with which he was
occasionally dosed. With a wry face he took a long
swallow from the bottle. Ollie Kuhns hung round
his neck the little bag filled with asaf&oelig;dita, which
had been used in a similar manner for the baby&#39;s
whooping-cough, and Jimmie Weygandt applied to
himself the contents of a flask from the barn window,
labeled &quot;Dr. Whitcraft&#39;s Embrocation, Good
for Man and Beast.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All left their homes and walked down the street
with the stiff uprightness of carriage which had
prevented their families from realizing how grievously
they were afflicted. But one and all, they forgot
their household chores. Billy Knerr&#39;s mother
commanded him loudly to return and to fill the coal
bucket, but Billy walked on as calmly as though
he were deaf, and turned the corner into the alley
with a thankful sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">There his erectness vanished. He stood and rubbed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
his knee with a mournful &quot;By Hedes!&quot; an exclamation
of unknown origin and supposed profanity
much affected by him and his friends, and henceforth
walked with a limp. A little ahead was Ollie
Kuhns, who, when shouted at, turned round bodily
and stood waiting as stiff and straight as a wooden
soldier. It was difficult to believe that this was the
supple &quot;Bosco, the Wild Man, Eats &#39;em Alive,&quot; who
rattled his chains and raised his voice in terrifying
howls in the schoolhouse cellar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where have <i>you</i> got it?&quot; demanded Billy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In my neck. I cannot move my head an inch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have it in my knee. Indeed, I thought I would
never get out of bed. My mom is hollering after
me yet to fetch coal, but I could not fetch coal if
they would chop off my head for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you suppose any one else has it like this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Billy did not need to answer. The alley through
which they walked led out to the pike, where moved
before them a strange procession. The vanquished
after a battle could have worn no more agonized
aspect, could not have been much more strangely
contorted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Both my arms are stiff,&quot; wailed Coonie Schnable.
&quot;It is one side as bad as the other.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t bend over,&quot; announced the older Fackenthal,
woefully. &quot;I gave my little sister a penny to tie
my shoes and not say anything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did any of you tell your folks?&quot; demanded
Ollie. &quot;Because if you did we will all get thrashed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
A spirited &quot;No!&quot; answered the insulting question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I got one licking from my pop last week,&quot;
mourned Billy Knerr. &quot;That will last, anyhow a
while.&quot; The pain in Billy&#39;s knee was so sharp that
sometimes, in spite of all his efforts, tears rolled
down his cheeks. &quot;You&#39;ll never catch me in that
dam again, so you know it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It wasn&#39;t the dam,&quot; said David Hartman, irritably.
David could not indicate a spot on his body
which did not ache. &quot;We were too hot and we stayed
too long. Ach! Ouch! I&#39;ll&mdash;&quot; The other pupils
of the Millerstown school had crowded about the
sufferers and had jostled against them and David
turned stiffly upon them with murder in his heart.
But it was impossible to pursue even the nearest
offender, Alvin Koehler. Instead David cried babyishly,
&quot;Just you wait once till I catch you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Not for the world would unsuspecting Alvin have
jostled him intentionally. He knew better than to
offer to any schoolmate a gage to physical conflict.
They were too strong and there were too many of
them. He saw the jostled David speak to Billy
Knerr; he saw Billy Knerr approach him and he
turned, ready for flight.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Alvin&#39;s eyes opened, his cheeks flushed.
Billy called to him in a tone which was almost beseeching,
&quot;Wait once, Alvin! Do you want to
make some money, Alvin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At once the red tie, still coveted and sighed for,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
danced before Alvin&#39;s longing eyes. Money! he
would do anything to make money! He stood still
and let Billy approach, not quite daring to trust
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What money?&quot; he asked, hopefully, yet suspiciously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come over here once,&quot; said Billy.</p>

<p class="indent">With great hope and at the same time with deadly
fear, Alvin ventured toward the afflicted crew.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have the rheumatism,&quot; explained Billy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where?&quot; asked Alvin stupidly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where!&quot; stormed Ollie, with a violence which
almost ended the negotiations. &quot;Where! In our
legs and our backs and our arms and our eyelids.&quot;
Ollie was not one to wait with patience. &quot;We will
give you a penny each for a bee in a bottle. Will
you sell us a bee in a bottle, or won&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin&#39;s eyes glittered; fright gave place to joy.
There has always been a tradition in Millerstown
that the sting of a bee will cure rheumatism. The
theory has nothing to do with witchcraft or pow-wowing;
it seems more like the brilliant invention of
a practical joker. Perhaps improvement was coincident
with the original experiment, or perhaps the
powerful counter-irritant makes the sufferer forget
the lesser woe. Bee stings are not popular, it must
be confessed; they are used as a last resort, like the
saline infusion, or like a powerful injection of strychnia
for a failing heart.</p>

<p class="indent">Strangers had often come to be stung by William
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
Koehler&#39;s bees, but Alvin had never heard that any
of them were cured. Alvin himself had tried the
remedy once for a bruise with no good result. One
patient had used violent language and had demanded
the return of the nickel which he had given William,
and William was weak enough to pass it over. But
now the red tie fluttered more and more enticingly
before Alvin&#39;s eyes. If he could earn seven cents by
putting seven of his father&#39;s bees in bottles, well and
good. It made no difference if the patients were
deceived about the salutary effects of bee stings.</p>

<p class="indent">Then into the quickened mind of Alvin flashed a
brilliant plan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will do it for three cents apiece,&quot; he announced
with craft. &quot;I cannot bann [charm] them so good
as pop. They will perhaps sting me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin&#39;s daring <i>coup</i> was successful.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, three cents, then. But you must get
them here by recess.&quot; Ollie Kuhns groaned. He
was not used to pain, and it seemed to him that his
agony was spreading to fresh fields. &quot;Clear out or
the teacher will get you and he won&#39;t let you go.
He&#39;s coming!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a great spring, Alvin dropped down on the
other side of the stone fence, and lay still until the
teacher had shepherded his flock into the schoolroom.
By this time not only the red tie, but a whole
new suit dazzled the eyes of Alvin. Old man Fackenthal
bottled his cough cure and sold it all about the
county. Why should not bees be bottled and labeled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
and sold? If their sting was supposed to be so
valuable a cure, they would be a desired commodity.
Alvin had told a lie when he had said he could
not &quot;bann&quot; bees as well as his father, for he had
over them the same hypnotic influence. He saw himself
spending the rest of his life raising them and
catching them and bottling them and selling them.
There would have to be air holes through the corks
of the bottles so that they could breathe, and a few
drops of honey within to nourish them, but with
these provisions they could be shipped far and wide.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They would be powerful mad when they were
let out,&quot; said Alvin to himself, as he lay in the lee
of the schoolhouse fence. &quot;The people would get
their money&#39;s worth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin saw suddenly all the old people in the world
stiff and sore and all the young people afflicted like
Ollie and his friends. He did not wish for any of
them such a fate. He had various weaknesses, but a
vindictive spirit was not one of them. He saw only
the possibilities of a great business. Hearing the
schoolhouse bell, and knowing that all were safely
within doors, he started across the fields and up the
mountain-side.</p>

<p class="indent">The bargain was consummated in the woodshed,
a little frame building leaning against the blank
wall of the schoolhouse. Alvin, hurrying back from
his house, scrambling over fences, weary from his
long run, thought that he was too early with the
wares in the basket on his arm. Or could it be, alas!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
that he was late and recess was over? That would
be too cruel! With relief he heard the sound of
voices in the woodshed where his patients awaited
him.</p>

<p class="indent">The truants had endured an hour and a half of
torture. They anticipated punishment for yesterday&#39;s
misdemeanor, and they had a deadly fear
that that punishment would be physical. Anxiously
now from the woodshed, where they could lie at
their ease, they listened for Alvin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps he won&#39;t come back,&quot; suggested Billy
Knerr. &quot;Perhaps he cannot catch the bees.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Recess was all over but five minutes, and the disheartened
sufferers were expecting the bell, when
Alvin appeared. David Hartman had collected the
money against such necessity for haste, and, indeed,
had advanced most of it from his well-lined pocket.
Only in such dire trouble would he have treated with
Alvin Koehler; only in this agony would he have
bought from any one such a pig in a poke. If he had
been himself, he would have made Alvin open the
basket and would have examined the contents to
be sure that Alvin was playing fair. But now, with
only two minutes to cure himself and his friends of
their agony, there was no time for the ordinary
inspection of the articles of trade.</p>

<p class="indent">The commodities exchanged hands; twenty-one
pennies into Alvin&#39;s outstretched palm, the basket
into David&#39;s. It took David not much more than
one of his hundred and twenty seconds to open the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
basket lid, even though it fitted closely and needed
prying. A low, angry murmur, which the boys had
not heard in their pain, changed at once to a loud
buzz, and suddenly the hearts of the most suffering
failed them. But the basket lid was off, and with it
came the lid of a fruit jar which stood within. The
bees were not in separate bottles&mdash;Alvin maintained
stoutly that separate bottles had not been stipulated&mdash;so
that one sting could be applied at a time, like
a drop of medicine from a pipette; they were,
or, rather, they had been, in a broad-mouthed jar,
whose lid, as I have said, came off with the basket
lid.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, at this instant the door of the woodshed,
impelled by a gentle May breeze, blew shut and the
latch dropped on the outside. There were seven
boys penned into the woodshed and there were at
least a hundred bees. Alvin had been in too much of
a hurry to count the precious things he sold. He
had held the jar before the outlet of the hive and
the bees had rushed into it. Granted that honey
bees sting but once, and granted that thirty of
these bees did not sting at all, there were still ten
for each patient.</p>

<p class="indent">Wildly the frantic prisoners batted the bees about
with their bare hands. There were no hats, there
was nothing in the empty woodshed which could be
used as a weapon. Piteously they yelled, from great
David Hartman to the eldest of the Fackenthals.</p>

<p class="indent">The uproar reached the ears of Alvin, who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
just entering the schoolhouse door and Alvin fled
incontinently to the gate and down the road. It
penetrated to the schoolroom and brought Mr. Carpenter
rushing angrily out. He had rung the school
bell; his pupils did not respond; he thought now that
their yells were yells of defiance. Emboldened by
yesterday&#39;s success they had arranged some new
anarchy. Whatever may have been the faults of
Mr. Carpenter, he was physically equal to such a
situation, short and slender though he was. He tore
open the woodshed door; he caught Ollie Kuhns
and shook him before any one could explain. Then,
as he reached for the collar of David Hartman, one
of the bees, which had not already committed suicide
by stinging, lit on his hand. The pain did little
to pacify the teacher. The boys, seized one after the
other, had no shame strong enough to keep them
from crying. Herded into the schoolroom, David at
the tail end with the teacher&#39;s grasp on his ear, they
forgot their rheumatism, they forgot the girls, they
forgot even Alvin himself, who was by this time flying
down the road. They laid their heads upon their
desks, and Mr. Carpenter, dancing about, demanded
first of one, then of the other, an explanation of this
madness. Mr. Carpenter forgot his objections to
Pennsylvania German; in this moment of deep anguish
he was compelled to have recourse to his native
tongue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; roared Mr. Carpenter.
&quot;What is this fuss? Are you crazy? You will catch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
it! Be quiet! Go to your seats! It will give an investigation
of this! Ruhig!!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In reality Mr. Carpenter himself was producing
most of the confusion. The grief of those at whom
he stormed was silent; they still sat with heads bent
upon their desks. At them their schoolmates gaped,
for them the tender-hearted wept.</p>

<p class="indent">As Alvin flew down the pike he began to be frightened.
He was not repentant, not with twenty-one
coppers in his pocket! He had a nickel already and
now the beautiful tie was his. He could not go at
once to purchase it for fear that the smitten army
behind him might rally and pursue, nor did he wish
to hide his money about the house for fear that his
father might find it. He decided that he would get
himself some dinner and then go walking upon the
mountain. It would be well to be away from home
until the time for his father&#39;s return. To his house
the lame legs of his schoolmates might follow him,
there their lame arms seize him, but to the Sheep
Stable they could not climb. He did not realize
that, as he crossed the fields above his father&#39;s house,
he was for a moment plainly exposed to the view of
the Millerstown school.</p>

<p class="indent">Tired, certain that he was out of reach of the
enemy, Alvin lay down on the great rock which
formed the back of the little cave. His heart
throbbed; he was not accustomed to such strenuous
exertion of body or to such rapid and determined
operations of mind. He was even a little frightened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
by his own bravery and acuteness. He thought for
a long time of himself and for a little time of Katy
Gaumer and Essie Hill; then, deliciously comfortable
in the spring sunshine, he fell asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">For three hours Alvin lay still on the great rock.
Occasionally a chestnut blossom drifted down on
his cheek, and was brushed drowsily away; occasionally
the chatter of a squirrel, impatient of this
human intrusion, made him open his eyes heavily.
But each time he dropped into deeper sleep. The
rock was hard, but Alvin was young and, besides,
was not accustomed to a soft bed.</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of three hours he woke suddenly. It
seemed to him that a dark cloud had covered the
sun or that night had fallen. But a worse danger
than storm or darkness was at hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Above him, almost touching his own, bent an
angry face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get up!&quot; commanded a stern voice, and Alvin
slid off the rock and stood up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, fight,&quot; David ordered. &quot;I was stiff but I
am not so much stiff any more. But the stiffness
you may have for advantage. One, two, three!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even with the handicap of stiffness, the advantage
was upon the side of David. He was strong; he
was furiously and righteously angry; he had been
shamed in the eyes of Millerstown. Katy Gaumer
had seen his ignominy; she had whispered about
him to Sarah Knerr. Alvin was a coward; he had
long been cheating; he had accepted the help of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
girl. Besides, Katy Gaumer was kind to him. For
that crime his punishment had long been gathering.</p>

<p class="indent">Automatically Alvin raised his fist. Below them
was the steep, rock-piled hillside; back of them was
the rock wall of the Sheep Stable; and there was no
help nearer than Millerstown, far below in its girdle
of tender green. Even through the still air Alvin&#39;s
cries could not be heard in the valley. He cried out
when David struck him; he begged for mercy when
David laid him on his back on the stony ground.
He thought that there was now no hope for him; he
was certain that his last hour had come. He expected
that David would hurl him down over the
edge of the precipice to the sharp rocks far below.
He closed his eyes and moaned.</p>

<p class="indent">David had already determined to let his victim
go. He was suddenly deeply interested in certain
sensations within himself; he was distracted from
his intention of administering to Alvin all the punishment
he deserved. He felt a strange, uplifted
sensation, a consciousness of strength; he was excited,
thrilled. Never before in his life had he acted
so swiftly, so entirely upon impulse. The yielding
body beneath him, Alvin&#39;s fright, made him seem
powerful to himself. The world was suddenly a different
place; he wanted now to be alone and to think.</p>

<p class="indent">But David had no time to think. As unexpectedly
as though sent from heaven itself arrived the avenger.
Katy Gaumer had found time dull and heavy on her
hands. Alvin had vanished; there would be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
same lessons for the next day since one third of the
class was absent and one third incapacitated. Katy
was amused at the tears of David and his friends.
A bee sting was nothing, nor yet a little stiffness!
Katy had been once stung by a hornet and she had
had a sprained ankle. Katy&#39;s heart was light; she
had had recently new compliments from the doctor
about her voice, and she had determined that this
afternoon she would ascend to the Sheep Stable and
startle the wide valley with song.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy was not lame or afflicted; she climbed gayly
the mountain road. Nor was Katy afraid. She would
not have believed that any evil could befall one so
manifestly singled out by Providence for good fortune.
She sang as she went; therefore she did not
hear the wails of Alvin. Alvin cried loudly as he lay
upon the ground; therefore he did not hear the song
of Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">But Alvin felt suddenly the weight shoved from
his body; he saw the conqueror taken unawares,
thrust in his turn upon the ground; and he had wit
and strength enough to scramble to his feet when
the incubus was removed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shame on you!&quot; cried the figure in the red
dress to the figure prone upon the ground. &quot;Shame
on you! You big, ugly boy, lie there!&quot; Katy almost
wept in her wrath. It was unfortunate for Katy that
she should have been called upon to behold one
toward whom her heart was already unwisely inclined
thus in need of pity and help.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
To Alvin&#39;s amazement the conqueror, a moment
ago mighty in his rage, obeyed. The arrival of Katy,
sudden as it was to him, was even more sudden to
David. David was overwhelmed, outraged. He had
not wit to move; he heard Katy&#39;s taunts, saw her
stamp her foot; he heard her command Alvin to
come with her, saw her for an instant even take
Alvin by the hand, and saw Alvin follow her. His
eyes were blinded; he rubbed them cruelly, then he
turned over on his face and dug his hands into the
ground. From poor David&#39;s hot throat there came
again that childish wail. Conquered thus, David
was also spiritless; he began to cry, &quot;I want her! I
want her! I want her!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Aching, motionless, he lay upon the ground. With
twitching tail the squirrel watched from his bough,
chattering again his disgust at this queer human
use of his abiding-place. The air grew cool, the
blazing sun sank lower, and David lay still.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, down the mountain road together
went Katy Gaumer and Alvin Koehler.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He came on me that quick,&quot; gasped Alvin. He
had brushed the clinging twigs from his clothes and
had smoothed his hair. His curls lay damp upon his
forehead, and his cheeks were scarlet, his chin uplifted.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy breathed hard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I came on him quick, too!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin began to gasp nervously. Self-pity overwhelmed
him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
&quot;I have nothing in this world,&quot; mourned he.
&quot;This summer I will have to work at the furnace.
I will have a hard life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I thought you were going to have an education!&quot;
cried Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot,&quot; mourned Alvin. &quot;It is no use to try.
I am alone in the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy turned upon him a glowing face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is nonsense, Alvin! Everybody can have
an education. There are schools where you can
study and work, too. It is so at the normal school
where they learn you to teach. I thought you were
going to be a teacher, Alvin!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was,&quot; said Alvin. &quot;I would like to be a teacher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will find out about those schools,&quot; promised
Katy, forever eager to help, to plan. &quot;I am going
away; nothing would keep me in Millerstown. You
must surely go, Alvin!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;David Hartman can have everything,&quot; wailed
Alvin, his aching bones making themselves felt.
&quot;He had no business to come after me. He has a
rich pop. He&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has a horrible pop,&quot; answered Katy. &quot;He
chased me once when I was little, and I never did
him anything. Why, Alvin!&quot; Katy stopped in the
dusty road. &quot;There is David&#39;s pop in his buggy at
your gate!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin grew deathly pale, he remembered his
father&#39;s madness, his threats, the crime which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
had committed and which he blamed upon John
Hartman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot; cried Katy. &quot;What ails you, Alvin?
He would not dare to touch me now that I am big.
Come!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No!&quot; Alvin would not move. &quot;Look once at
him, Katy! Something is the matter with him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not afraid,&quot; insisted Katy bravely. &quot;I
am&mdash;he is sick, Alvin; he is sitting quiet in his
buggy.&quot; She went close to the wheel. &quot;Mr. Hartman!&quot;
She turned and looked at Alvin, then back
at the figure in the buggy. &quot;His head hangs down,
Alvin, and he will not answer me. I believe he is
dead, Alvin!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly Alvin moved to Katy&#39;s side. He laid a hand
upon her arm&mdash;Katy thought it was to protect
her; in reality Alvin sought support in his deadly
fear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe it, too, Katy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Speechlessly the two gazed at each other. When
Alvin had shouted wildly for his father and Katy
had joined her voice to his and there was no answer,
the two set off, hand in hand, running recklessly
down the mountain road.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
WILLIAM KOEHLER MAKES HIS ACCUSATION FOR THE LAST TIME</h2>

<p class="indent">Dusk was falling when David started down the
mountain road. He did not walk rapidly; sometimes,
in his weakness, he stumbled. Bad as his
aches had been when he climbed the mountain hours
before, they were worse now, and added to them was
smart of soul. Every spot on his body upon which
Katy had laid her hand burned; she was continually
before his eyes in her kaleidoscopic motions, now
running down the pike from school, now storming
at him as he lay on the ground. He tried to hate
her, but he could not. As he stumbled along, his feet
kept time to a foolish wail, &quot;I want her! I want
her!&quot; The glow of triumph had faded entirely;
David was more morose, more sullen, more unhappy
than ever. His anger with Alvin had changed to a
sly intention to scheme against him until he could
give him a greater punishment than a mere beating.
He was not done with Alvin! His own father was
a rich and powerful man; Alvin&#39;s father was a poor,
half-witted thief. He thought for the first time with
satisfaction of his father&#39;s wealth.</p>

<p class="indent">The young moon overhead, the scent of spring
in the air, the gentle breeze against his cheek, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
deepened his misery and loneliness. He said to himself
that he had no one in the world. In spite of
his vague conclusions about his father, his father
was still the same. There are persons whose success
depends wholly upon their relations with the human
beings nearest to them. Given affection, they expand;
denied it, their souls contract, their powers
fail. It is a weakness of the human creature, but it
is none the less real. Resentment was rapidly becoming
a settled attitude of David&#39;s mind; his father
was postponing dangerously that opening of his
heart to his son of which he thought day and night.</p>

<p class="indent">David wished now that he need not go home; he
wished&mdash;poor little David!&mdash;that he was dead. He
would have his supper and he would go to bed, and
to-morrow there would be another bitter day. He
would sit in school and be conscious of Katy and
Alvin and their knowing glances, and love and hate
would tear him asunder once more.</p>

<p class="indent">Then David stood still and looked down upon
his house. Even though the trees about it were
thickly leafed, he could see lights in unaccustomed
places. The parlor was lighted; in that room David
could not remember an illumination in his lifetime.
There were lights also in bedrooms&mdash;David forgot
his aches of body and soul in his astonishment. He
slept over the kitchen in one of the little rooms his
father had provided for the day when servants
should attend upon the wants of his children;
except for his father&#39;s and mother&#39;s room the front
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
of the house was never opened. Had some great
stranger come to visit&mdash;but that was unthinkable!
Was some one ill&mdash;but that would be no reason for
the opening of the house! David did not know what
to make of the strange sight. He hurried down the
road, almost falling as he ran.</p>

<p class="indent">Then David stood still, looking stupidly at a
dark wagon which stood before the gate. He knew
the ownership and the purpose of that vehicle, but
he could not connect it with his house. There dwelt
only his father and his mother and himself, and all
of them were alive and well.</p>

<p class="indent">A group of children lingered near by, silent, staring
at the dark wagon and the brightly lighted windows.
The Hartman house with its illumination
was as strange a phenomenon as the Millerstown
children had ever seen. To them David, still standing
at his gate, put a question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Instantly a small, excited, feminine voice piped
out an answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your father is dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was sitting in his buggy in the mountain
road,&quot; another excited voice went on. &quot;They
brought him down here and carried him in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David went into the yard and along the flag walk,
and for the first time in his life entered his father&#39;s
house by the wide-open front door, through which
various Millerstonians were passing in and out.
This was a great opportunity for Millerstown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
Some one came out of the parlor, leaving the door
ajar, and David saw a long dark figure lying on a
low couch in the middle of the room. What there
was to be known about his father&#39;s death he gathered
from the conversation of those about him. He heard
pitying exclamations, he felt that in a moment he
would burst into cries of shock and terror. Bitterness
fled, he was soft-hearted, weak, childlike. His
father was gone, but there remained another person.
He must find her; in her lay his refuge; she must be
his stay, as he must henceforth be hers. Stumbling
back through the hall toward the kitchen, he sought
his mother. He was aware of the kind looks of those
about him; his whole being was softened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother!&quot; he meant to cry. &quot;Oh, mother!
mother!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He felt her grief; he expected to find her prostrate
on the old settle, or sitting by the table with her
head on her arm, weeping. He would comfort her;
he would be a good son to her; he truly loved
her.</p>

<p class="indent">From the kitchen doorway he heard her voice,
clear and toneless, the voice of every day. She was
giving orders to the Millerstown women who had
hastened in with offers of help,&mdash;to Grandmother
Gaumer and Sarah Knerr and Susannah Kuhns.
She indicated certain jars of canned fruit which
were to be used for the funeral dinner, and planned
for the setting of raised cake and the baking of &quot;fine
cake.&quot; In Cassie&#39;s plan for her life, she had prepared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
for this contingency; even now her iron will
was not broken, nor her stern composure lost. She
moved about as David had always seen her move,
quiet, capable, self-centered. She shed no tear; she
seemed to David to take actual pleasure in planning
and contriving.</p>

<p class="indent">The frantic cry, already on David&#39;s lips, died
silently away, his throat stiffened, he drew a long
breath. For an instant he stood still in the doorway;
then, with a bent and sullen head, he turned
and crept back through the hall to the front stairs,
which had scarcely ever been touched by his foot,
and thence to his tiny room, where he knelt down by
his narrow bed. How terrible was the strange figure
under the black covering, with the blazing lights
beating upon it, and the staring villagers stealing in
to look! It seemed incredible that his father could
lie still and suffer their scrutiny. He wished that he
might go down and turn them out. But he did not
dare to trust his voice, and besides, his mother accepted
it all as though it were proper and right.
Then David forgot the intruders, forgot his mother.
His father was dead, of whom he had often thought
unkindly, and his father was all he had in the world.
He would never be able to speak to him again, never
be able to lay a hand upon his shoulder as he sat
reading his paper, never meet again that sudden
glance of incomprehensible distress. Death worked
its alchemy; now at last the poor father had his way
with his son&#39;s heart.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
&quot;He was my father!&quot; cried David. &quot;I have no
father!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His breath choked, his heart seemed to smother
him; he felt himself growing light-headed as he
knelt by the low bed. He had had nothing to eat
since noon; he had had since that time many things
to suffer; he thought suddenly in his exhaustion
that perhaps he, too, was about to die.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently there was a step in the hall and his
heart leaped. Perhaps his mother had come, perhaps
she did not wish to show her grief to these
curious people. But the person outside knocked
at the door and his mother would not have knocked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot; asked David.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is me,&quot; said Bevy. &quot;I brought you a little
something to eat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bevy waited outside, plate and glass in hand.
She had seen David&#39;s entrance and exit. Prompted
now partly by kindness and sympathy, and partly
by an altogether human and natural curiosity to
see as much of the house and the bereaved family
as she could, Bevy had carried him his supper. But
Bevy was not rewarded, as she had hoped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Put it down,&quot; commanded a voice from within.
&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bevy made another effort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you want anything, David?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, thank you,&quot; said the voice again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, well,&quot; answered Bevy and went down the
front steps. If Bevy could have had her wish, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
whole body would have been one great eye to take
in all this magnificence of thick carpets and fine
furniture.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, while the mother for whom he hungered
made her plans for the great funeral feast, still customary
in country sections, where mourners came
from a long distance, and while Katy Gaumer recounted
to curious Millerstown how she had found
John Hartman sitting in his buggy by the roadside,
David ate the raised cake and drank the milk which
Bevy brought him. Then he sat down by the window
and looked out into the dark foliage which on
this side touched the house. It had not been John
Hartman&#39;s plan to have his house grow damp in the
shadow of overhanging branches, but John Hartman
had long since forgotten his plans for everything.</p>

<p class="indent">Sitting here in the darkness, David thought of his
father. The puzzle of that strange character he
could not solve, but one thing became clear to his
mind. He saw again that yearning gaze; he remembered
from the dim, almost impenetrable mist
which surrounded his childhood, caresses, laughter,
the strong grasp of his father&#39;s arms. Finally he lay
down on the bed and went to sleep, a solemn, comforting
conclusion in his heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My father loved me,&quot; whispered David. &quot;I am
sure my father loved me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A little later David&#39;s mother opened his door
softly and entering stood by his bed. She had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
seen him in the kitchen; some one had told her that
he had come in and had gone to his room. She saw
that he was covered and that the night air did not
blow upon him, and then she took the empty plate
and glass and went back to the kitchen.</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin Koehler need not have suspected his father
of having had any hand in the death of John Hartman.
William Koehler was in the next village, where
he had half a day&#39;s work. While he worked he plotted
and planned and mumbled to himself about his
wrongs. It was apoplexy which had killed John
Hartman as he drove up the mountain road; Dr.
Benner told of his warnings, recalled to the mind of
Millerstown the scarlet flush which had for a long
time reddened John Hartman&#39;s face. If he had
taken the path so long avoided by him in order to
confess his crime to the man he had wronged and
thus begin to make his peace with God, he had set
too late upon that journey, for his hour had been
appointed. When William, walking heavily, with
his eyes on the ground, came home from Zion
Church, John Hartman lay already in the best room
of his house, his earthly account closed. When he
heard the news of John Hartman&#39;s death, William
seemed stupefied; it was hard to believe that he
understood what was said to him.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not necessary that any provision should be
made beyond the great dinner for the entertainment
of guests at the Hartman house. Nevertheless, the
house was cleaned and put in order from top to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
bottom for its master&#39;s burying. Fluted pillow and
sheet shams and lace-trimmed pillow-cases were
brought forth, great feather beds were beaten into
smoothness, elaborate quilts were unfolded from protective
wrappings and were aired and refolded and
laid at the foot of beds covered with thick white
counterpanes. There was dusting and sweeping and
scrubbing, and, above all, a vast amount of cooking
and baking. The funeral was to be held in the morning,
and afterwards there would be food at the Hartman
house for all those who wished to partake.</p>

<p class="indent">Cassie was fitted with a black dress, various bonnets
were sent out from the county seat for her to
try, and over each was draped the long black veil
of widowhood,&mdash;this, to Cassie, in the opinion of
Millerstown, a crown of independence. Millerstown
could form no judgment of Cassie&#39;s feelings. If she
had, like William Koehler, any moment of stupefaction,
or, like David, any wild outburst of grief,
that fact was kept from a curious world.</p>

<p class="indent">David also was fitted with a suit of black, and
together he and his mother rode in a closed carriage,
sent from the county seat, down through pleasant
Millerstown in the May sunshine and out to the
church on the hill.</p>

<p class="indent">The service was long, as befitted the dignity of a
man of prominence like John Hartman who had
always given liberally to charitable objects, though
he had become of late years an infrequent attendant
at church meetings. The preacher who had heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
the accusation of William Koehler was long since
gone; the present pastor who lauded the Christian
life of the dead man knew nothing of any charge
against him. He would scarcely have known
William by sight, so entirely had William separated
himself from the life of the village. The preacher
had a deep, moving voice, he spoke with feeling of
the death of the righteous, and of the crown laid
up for them in heaven. Many of the congregation
wept, some in recollection of their own dead, some
in sad anticipation of that which must some day
befall themselves, and some in grief for John Hartman.
Two men, sitting in opposite corners of the
gallery, bowed their heads on the backs of the
benches before them so that their tears might drop
unseen. Oliver Kuhns, the elder, stayed at home
from the funeral and at home from his work, and
watched from the window the procession entering
the church, and wept also. John Hartman was not
without mourners who called him blessed!</p>

<p class="indent">David and his mother sat in the front pew, near
the body, which had been placed before the pulpit.
Upon David had settled a heavy weight of horror.
He had not yet accustomed himself to the fact of his
father&#39;s death. Only a few days before he had seen
his father moving about, had sought to read the
enigmatic expression in his eyes. But here his father
lay, dead. Living he would never have suffered
these stares, this weeping. Upon David, also, rested
the interested, inquisitive eyes. From the gallery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
Katy Gaumer looked down upon him; from a seat
near her Alvin Koehler stared about. The smothering
desire to cry rushed over David once more; he
slipped his hand inside his stiff collar as though to
choke off the rising sob. Beside him rose the black
pillar of his mother&#39;s crape; on the other side was
the closed door of the old-fashioned pew. He was
imprisoned; for him there was no escape. The service
would never end; here he would be compelled
to sit, forever and ever.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, suddenly, to the startled eyes of David and
of Millerstown, there rose in the right-hand gallery
the short, bent figure of a man. The preacher did
not see; Millerstown sat paralyzed. They had never
been really afraid of William Koehler, queer as he
was, but now there was madness in his face. His
eyes blazed, his cheeks were pale, he had scarcely
touched food since he had heard of the death of his
enemy. He had not gone to work; he had sat in his
little house talking to himself, and praying that he
might, after all, have some sort of revenge upon the
man who had wronged him. Several weeks ago he
had consulted a new detective, who, in the hope of
getting a fee, or wishing to have an excuse for getting
rid of him, had given him fresh encouragement.
The sudden ending of his hopes was all the
more cruel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have something to say,&quot; he announced now in
his shrill voice. &quot;This man lying here is not a good
man. I have this to say about him. He&mdash;he&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
Then poor William paused. Already, to his terror,
in spite of his practicing, the words were slipping
away from him. He had planned to tell the story
carefully, impressing each detail upon the large
congregation which would gather at the funeral.
They <i>must</i> listen to him. It would be useless to cry
out suddenly the whole truth, that John Hartman
was a thief&mdash;he had tried that once, and had been
silenced by the preacher. The detective had said
that he must get all his proofs carefully together.
He had arranged them in his poor, feeble mind; he
meant to speak as convincingly as the preacher himself.
His eyes were fixed on the smooth gray wall
beside the pulpit cupboard; the sight of it helped to
keep his mind clear. There he had been working on
the day when the communion set was taken.</p>

<p class="indent">He rubbed his damp hands down the sides of his
dusty suit, and a flush came into his cheeks. He
remembered clearly once more what he had to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was building up the wall,&quot; he said with great
precision. &quot;I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Stupidly he halted. He began to grow frightened;
the unfriendly faces paralyzed his brain; the words
he had planned so carefully slipped all at once away
from him. He pointed at the still figure lying in
front of the pulpit and burst into vehement, frantic
speech.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He stole the communion set!&quot; he cried shrilly.
&quot;He stole it! He&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Poor William got no further. Many persons rose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
The two men in opposite corners of the gallery who
had wept started toward him; one of them opened
his lips, as though, like crazy William, he was about
to address the congregation. The paralyzed spectators
came to their senses. Hands were laid upon
William. The deacons and elders of the church
went toward the gallery steps, Grandfather Gaumer
among them. Even Alvin in his mortification and
shame had still feeling enough to go to his father&#39;s
side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come away, pop!&quot; he begged. &quot;Ach, be quiet,
pop, and come away!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He tells me to be quiet!&quot; cried William in the
same shrill tone. &quot;My son tells me to be quiet!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandfather Gaumer laid a firm hand on his
shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come with me, William.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But William was not to be got so quietly away.
In the front pew young David had risen. Was his
father not now to have a decent burying? David&#39;s
face was aflame; he did not see the madness in the
shivering figure and the bright eyes of William
Koehler. William belonged with his son Alvin, and
both were hateful.</p>

<p class="indent">But David had no chance to speak. The preacher
foolishly held up a forbidding hand to poor William.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot say such a thing at this time and
not confess that it is not true. The accused cannot
answer for himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
Poor William rubbed his hands over his eyes. He
still had great respect for the authority of preachers.
Besides, he saw John Hartman suddenly as a dead
man, and since his trouble he had always been
afraid of death. No revenge could be visited upon
this deaf, impassible object, that was sure!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ach, I forget my mind!&quot; wailed poor William.
&quot;I forget my mind!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then William could have been led unresisting
away. But the preacher, stupidly insistent, held up
his hand again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you confess that your accusation is not true?&quot;
said he.</p>

<p class="indent">William placed a hand on either side of his forehead.
It seemed as though his head were bursting
and he must hold it close together. There was now
a murmur of speech in the congregation. This terrible
scene had gone on long enough; John Hartman
did not need defense from so absurd an accusation.
Then the murmur ceased.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No!&quot; cried William. &quot;It is not true. I took the
communion set myself!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">William was now led away, a final seal put upon
the pit in which his honesty and sanity lay buried.
Another unforgivable offense was added to the sum
of unforgivable offenses of the son of William
Koehler toward young David. The confession did
not help the Millerstown church to recover its
beautiful silver. William&#39;s insanity, the congregation
thought, was the only bar to its recovery.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
John Hartman was laid in the grave which had
been walled up by the mason who had taken William
Koehler&#39;s place in Millerstown, and which had been
lined with evergreens and life everlasting according
to Millerstown&#39;s tender custom. Over him prayers
were said and another hymn was sung, &quot;Aus tiefer
Noth shrei ich zu dir&quot; (Out of the depths I cry to
thee), familiar to generations of Millerstown&#39;s afflicted.
Then the procession returned to John Harman&#39;s
great house, whispering excitedly.</p>

<p class="indent">David sat in his room during the funeral dinner.
David was queer; he was not expected to do as other
people did. His fury with the Koehlers took his
thoughts to some extent away from his grief.</p>

<p class="indent">That night Cassie did not sleep in the great, comfortable
room at the front of the house which she
had shared with her husband, but in a room even
smaller than David&#39;s at the back. It contained,
instead of the great walnut four-poster, with its
high-piled feather bed to which she was accustomed,
a little painted pine bedstead and a chaff bag; it was
on the north corner of the house and was cold in
winter and deprived of the breeze by the thick
foliage in summer. Her husband&#39;s fortune was left
to her while she lived; afterwards it was to go to
David. Cassie was amply able to manage it, the
investments were safe, the farmers had been in her
husband&#39;s employ many years; it was not likely that
anything would disturb the smooth, dull current of
Cassie&#39;s life.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
There was much discussion in Millerstown about
whether it was safe for the community to allow
William Koehler to be at large; there was some comment
upon the cooking at the Hartman funeral
dinner; then Millerstown turned its attention to
other things. Cassie had behaved just as she might
have been expected to behave. It was surprising,
however, that she had let Millerstown go so thoroughly
through her house.</p>

<p class="indent">The day after the funeral David went back to the
Millerstown school. He did not glance in the direction
of Katy and Alvin, though he could not
help realizing that Katy&#39;s skirts did not flirt so
gayly past. Katy was sorry for him, though she did
not repent her treatment of him. Her dresses had
suddenly dropped several inches, her flying curls
were twisted up on her head, her eyes were brighter
than ever. She was filled with herself and her own
concerns and opinions; she grew daily more dictatorial,
more lordly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going away!&quot; said she, upon rising.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to be educated!&quot; said she at noon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can take education,&quot; said she at night. &quot;I
thank God I am not dumb!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She and Grandmother Gaumer were increasingly
busy with dressmakers&#39; patterns and with &quot;Lists of
Articles to be provided by Students.&quot; Life was at
high tide for Katy Gaumer.</p>

<p class="indent">Still David kept at the head of his class. In his
mind a slow plan was forming. He would think of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
Katy no more, of that he was determined, and he
would, as a means of accomplishing that end, leave
Millerstown. His mother was a rich woman; he
could do anything in the world he liked. He would
first of all go to college. Afterwards he would study
law.</p>

<p class="indent">In June he started late one Sunday afternoon to
walk to the Sheep Stable. Overwhelmed as he had
been upon that spot, he loved it too well to stay
away. The heavenly prospect was part of his life&#39;s
fabric and would continue to be all his days.</p>

<p class="indent">As he passed the Koehler house, he heard a
strange sound, apparently an unending repetition
of the same phrase. It was William Koehler at his
prayers&mdash;Millerstown knew now for what William
prayed!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;God will punish <i>him</i>!&quot; said David with a hot,
dry throat. &quot;If there is a God&quot;&mdash;thus said David
in his foolish youth&mdash;&quot;if there is a God, he will
punish him! Oh, I wish, I wish I could see my
father!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the Sheep Stable, as one who opens the book
of the dim past, David took his pipe and cards from
their hiding-place and hurled them far down the
mountain-side. He even managed to smile a little
sorely at himself.</p>

<p class="indent">It was dark when he returned to the village. He
did not like to walk about in the early evenings, past
the groups of Millerstonians on the doorsteps; they
talked about him, and he did not like to be talked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
about. Now almost all Millerstown had gone to
church. The pastor of the Improved New Mennonites
was conducting a meeting in a neighboring village,
but there was service in all the other churches.
A few persons sat on their doorsteps, listening quietly
to the music which filled the air,&mdash;the sound of
the beautiful German hymns of the Lutherans and
the Reformed, and the less classic compositions of the
New Baptists. Millerstown was like a great common
room on summer evenings, with the friendly sky for
ceiling.</p>

<p class="indent">Again the young moon rode high in the heavens;
again David&#39;s young blood throbbed in his veins;
again the miserable, unmanly desire for the girl
who would have nothing to do with him began to
devour him. He bit his lips, wondering drearily
where he should go and what he should do. The
night had just begun; he would not be sleepy for
hours. Nothing invited him to the kitchen or to the
two little bedrooms to which Cassie had restricted
their living. He had no books, and books would
have been after all poor companions on such a night
as this.</p>

<p class="indent">David was not an ill-looking boy; he had indeed
the promise of growing handsome as he grew older;
he was many times richer than any other young
man of Millerstown. There were probably only two
girls in the village to whom these pleasant characteristics
would make no appeal. The first of these
was Katy Gaumer. The second was smooth, pretty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
blue-eyed Essie Hill, the daughter of the preacher
of the Improved New Mennonites, who sat now
demurely on her father&#39;s doorstep. Beside her David
suddenly sat himself down.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br/>
CHANGE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> sometimes happens that death gathers from a
single spot a large harvest in a year. We seem to
have been forgotten; we learn to draw once more the
long, secure breath of youth; we almost believe that
sorrow will no more visit us.</p>

<p class="indent">For many months Millerstown had had scarcely a
funeral. In security Millerstown went about its
daily tasks. Then, in May, John Hartman was
found dead along the mountain road.</p>

<p class="indent">In June there came a letter from the Western
home of Great-Uncle Gaumer, telling of a serious
illness and the rapid approach of the end of his life.
A few days later, when a telegram announced his
death, Grandfather Gaumer himself dropped to the
floor in the office of his brother the squire and
breathed no more. Dr. Benner, who was passing,
heard from the street the crash of his fall and the
squire&#39;s loud outcry, and Bevy rushed in from the
kitchen. The doctor and the squire knelt beside
him, and still kneeling there, regarded each other
with amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">Bevy Schnepp lifted her hands above her head
and cried out, &quot;Lieber Himmel!&quot; and stood as if
rooted to the floor. &quot;Who will tell her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
The squire rose from his knees, pale and unsteady,
and stood looking at his brother as though the sight
were incredible.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is there no life?&quot; he asked the doctor in a
whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor shook his head. &quot;He was gone before
he fell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bevy began to cry. &quot;Ach, who will tell her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will tell her,&quot; answered the squire. Then he
went round the house and across to the other side of
the homestead where Grandmother Gaumer and
Katy sat at their sewing.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a quantity of white material on Grandmother
Gaumer&#39;s lap, and her fingers moved the
needle swiftly in and out. Katy was talking as she
hemmed a scarlet ruffle&mdash;Katy was always talking.
She had been shocked by the news of the governor&#39;s
illness, but she believed that he would get well.
Besides, she had seen the governor only once in her
life, and her grandfather had assured her that her
plans for her education need not be changed. She
could not be long unhappy over anything when all
these beautiful new clothes were being made for her
and when she was soon to leave dull Millerstown,
and when Alvin Koehler had twice sat on the doorstep
with her. She had journeyed to the county
seat with her grandmother and there had made
wonderful purchases.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the ladies in the stores are so fine, and so
polite, and they show you everything,&quot; said Katy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
&quot;When Louisa Kuhns went to Allentown she said,
&#39;the people are me so unpolite, they go always
bumping and bumping and they don&#39;t even say <i>uh</i>!&#39;
That is not true. I do not believe there is anywhere
in the world a politer place than Allentown.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Louisa&mdash;&quot; No gap between subjects halted
Katy&#39;s speech; she leaped it with a bound. &quot;Louisa
is very dumb. Now I do not believe myself that a
person can learn everything. But you can train
your mind so that you can understand everything
if it is explained to you. You must keep your mind
all the time busy and you must be very humble.
Louisa said that poetry was dumb. Louisa cannot
even understand, &#39;Where, oh, where are the visions
of morning?&#39; Louisa thinks everything must be real.
I said to her I would be ashamed to talk that way.
The realer poetry is the harder it is. But Louisa!
Ach, my! Gran&#39;mom! The teacher said Louisa
should write &#39;pendulum&#39; in a sentence, and Louisa
wrote &#39;Pendulum Franklin is dead&#39;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you like poetry, Katy?&quot; asked Grandmother
Gaumer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some,&quot; answered Katy. &quot;It is not the fault of
the poetry that I cannot understand it all. I want to
understand everything. I do not mean, gran&#39;mom,
that you cannot be good unless you understand
everything. But there is more in this world than
being good. Sarah Ann is good, but Sarah Ann has
a pretty slow time in this world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sarah Ann does many kind things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
&quot;But the squire and gran&#39;pop do more because
they are smarter,&quot; said Katy triumphantly. &quot;When
the people want advice, do they go to Sarah Ann?
They come to the squire or to gran&#39;pop!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandmother Gaumer smiled. Sometimes Katy
talked in borrowed phrase about a &quot;larger vision&quot;
or &quot;preparation for a larger life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Millerstown!&quot; said Katy with a long sigh and a
shake of the head. &quot;I could not stay forever in
Millerstown, gran&#39;mom. Think of the Sunday School
picnics with the red mint candy on the cakes and
how Susannah and Sarah Knerr try to have the
highest layer cakes, and each wants the preacher to
eat. Think of the Copenhagen, gran&#39;mom, and the
Bingo and the Jumbo, gran&#39;mom!&quot; In derision
Katy began to sing, &quot;A certain farmer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandmother Gaumer leaned forward in her chair.
A sense of uneasiness overwhelmed her, though
Katy had heard nothing. &quot;Listen, Katy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was nothing to be heard; Grandfather
Gaumer had fallen; beside him knelt his brother and
the doctor; aghast Bevy flung her arms above her
head; all were as yet silent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is nothing, gran&#39;mom,&quot; said Katy. Katy
began her chattering again; she laughed now because
Bevy had said that it brought bad luck to use black
pins on white material or to sew when the clock
struck twelve. Grandmother Gaumer went on with
her stitching. A boy ran down the street; the sound
disturbed her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
&quot;I will go and see,&quot; offered Katy, putting the
scarlet ruffles off her lap. She did not move as
swiftly as she would have moved six months ago.
Then the sound of rapid steps would have drawn
her promptly in their wake. But the affairs of
Millerstown had ceased to be of great importance.
She did not even hate Millerstown now. &quot;I guess it
is just a boy running, gran&#39;mom. I guess&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The squire had thought that he would go bravely
to Grandmother Gaumer and put his arm round her
and break to her gently the terrible news. He did
not realize that his lips and hands grew each moment
more tremulous and his cheeks more ashen. He saw
his sister-in-law sitting beside her lovely garden in
security and peace, and his heart failed him.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy had risen to her feet, and she stood still and
regarded him with astonishment. She had forgotten
for the instant that he was awaiting news of Governor
Gaumer&#39;s death. Now she remembered it and
was disturbed to the bottom of her soul by the
squire&#39;s evident grief. Grief was new to Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">Grandmother Gaumer laid down her needle and
thread. &quot;Ach, the governor is gone, then!&quot; said she.
&quot;Did a letter come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered the squire. &quot;A message came.
He died in the night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tears came into Grandmother Gaumer&#39;s eyes.
&quot;Where is William? I thought he was by you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The squire sat down in the chair beside Grandmother
Gaumer and took her hand. The heap of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
white stuff slid off her lap to the floor of the porch
and lay there unheeded until hours later when Bevy
gathered it up, weeping, and laid it away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have bad news for you,&quot; said the squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Grandmother Gaumer, bravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When William heard that Daniel was gone, he
dropped to the floor like one shot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;William!&quot; cried Grandmother Gaumer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered the squire. &quot;He suffered no
pain. The doctor said he knew nothing of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Knew nothing of it!&quot; repeated Grandmother
Gaumer. &quot;You mean that he fell <i>dead</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is he?&quot; asked Grandmother Gaumer in
a quieter tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In my office. They will bring him home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then we will make a place ready for him. Come,
Katy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy followed into the kitchen. Grandmother
Gaumer stood looking about her and frowning, as
though she were finding it difficult to decide what
should be done. Katy thought of John Hartman
and of his strange attitude and his staring eyes.
Would Grandfather Gaumer look like that? Katy
was about to throw herself into the arms which had
thus far opened to all her griefs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ach, gran&#39;mom!&quot; she began, weeping.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, slowly, Grandmother Gaumer turned her
head and looked at Katy. Her eyes were intolerable
to Katy.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
&quot;What shall I do?&quot; she asked. &quot;I am old. I cannot
think. We have lived together fifty years. I
cannot remember where my things are. There are
things put away in the bureaus all ready for such a
time. What shall I do, Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a gasp Katy drove back the tears from her
smarting eyelids. Katy was confused, bewildered;
she still lacked the education with which she expected
to meet the problems of life. But Katy,
whose forte was managing, did not fail here.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will sit here in this chair, gran&#39;mom. I
will get a white pillow to put on the settee and they
can lay gran&#39;pop there. Then we will find the things
for them.&quot; She guided her grandmother to the armchair
and helped her to sit down. Even the touch of
her body seemed different. &quot;It will take only a
minute for me to go upstairs. I will be back right
away. You know how quickly I can run.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When Katy returned, the feet of the bearers were
at the door. With them Millerstown crowded in,
weeping. Grandmother Gaumer had wept with
them, Grandfather Gaumer had helped them in
their troubles. Grandfather was laid in state in the
best room and presently the house settled into quiet.
In this house five generations had met grief with
dignity and death with hope; thus they should be
met once more.</p>

<p class="indent">Preparations were begun at once for the laying
away of the body in the little graveyard of the
church which the soul had loved. At the feet of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
mother, beside his little sister, a grave was dug for
William Gaumer and was lined with boughs of arbor
vitæ and sprays of life everlasting.</p>

<p class="indent">In the Gaumer house there was little sweeping
and cleaning; the beds were not made up for show,
but were prepared for the gathering relatives.
Grandfather Gaumer did not lie alone in the best
room as John Hartman had lain; his children and
his grandchildren went in and sat beside him and
talked of him.</p>

<p class="indent">When the funeral was over and the house was in
order and the relatives had gone, Katy sat on her
little stool at her grandmother&#39;s knee and cried her
fill. Grandmother Gaumer had not given way to
grief. She had moved about among her kin, she had
given directions, she had wept only a little.</p>

<p class="indent">To Katy there was not now a ray of brightness in
the world.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing is certain,&quot; she mourned. &quot;My gran&#39;pop
brought me up. I was always by him, he was my
father. I cannot get along without him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will feel certain again of this world, Katy,&quot;
her grandmother assured her. &quot;You must not mourn
for grandfather. He had a long, long life. You
would not have him back where he would get lame
and helpless after while. That is worse, Katy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But there are many things I would like to say to
him. I never told him enough how thankful I was
to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He knew you were thankful. Now you are to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
go to school. Everything is to be just as it was
planned.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy burst into tears once more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ach, I do not think of school!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, her heart beat a little faster. There
was, after all, something right in the world. Moreover,
she still had another person to think of. That
day Alvin Koehler&#39;s dark eyes had looked down
upon her as she sat by her grandmother in church.
She had promised to help Alvin; his eyes reminded
her consciously or unconsciously of her promise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Uncle Edwin and I talked this over,&quot;
went on Grandmother Gaumer. &quot;You have two
hundred dollars from the governor in the bank in
your name and the squire and Uncle Edwin and I
will all help. You are to go right on, Katy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wasn&#39;t thinking about school,&quot; persisted Katy.
&quot;I was thinking about my grandfather.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandmother Gaumer laid a trembling hand on
Katy&#39;s head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was always good and kind, Katy, you must
never forget that. He was first of all good; that is the
best thing. He did what he could for everybody,
and everybody loved him. You see what Millerstown
thought of him. See that Millerstown thinks
that well of you! You must never forget him, never.
He loved you&mdash;he loved you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Grandmother Gaumer repeated what she had
said in a strange way, then she ceased to speak, and
Katy, startled, lifted her head. Then she got to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
feet. She had become familiar in these last weeks
with the gray pallor of a mortal seizure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gran&#39;mom!&quot; shrieked Katy. &quot;Gran&#39;mom!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Only the gaze of a pair of bright, troubled eyes
answered her. Grandmother&#39;s face was twisted, her
hands fell heavily into her lap.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy threw her arms round her and laid her cheek
against the white hair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will be back, dear, dear gran&#39;mom,&quot; said Katy.
&quot;You know how I can run!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">An instant later, Katy had flung open the door
of the squire&#39;s office where sat the squire and Dr.
Benner. Her grandmother had insisted upon her
putting on her red dress after the funeral. She
paused now on the sill as she had paused in her bird-like
attitude to call to Caleb Stemmel in the store
at Christmas time. But this was a different Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, come!&quot; she cried. &quot;Oh, come, come quickly!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X<br/>
KATY MAKES A PROMISE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span> Gaumer was not dead. When the
squire and the doctor reached her side, she sat just
as Katy left her, erect, motionless, bright-eyed.
They put her to bed and there she lay with the same
bright, helpless gaze.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you understand me?&quot; asked the doctor
gently.</p>

<p class="indent">The expression in the brown eyes changed. The
flash of perception was almost invisible, but it was
there; to the eyes of Katy who stood by the bed,
breathless, terrified, it was as welcome as the cry of
a first-born child to its mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is conscious,&quot; the doctor assured them.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Edwin and Aunt Sally, whom Katy considered
so dull, returned presently in tearful haste
from their farm at the edge of the town. They sat
with grandmother while the doctor gave directions
for the night to Katy in the kitchen.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy looked at the doctor wildly. The lamp cast
dark shadows into the corners of the room; it surrounded
Katy with a glare of light. Her hands
clasped and unclasped, tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will my grandmother die?&quot; asked Katy in a
hollow voice.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
Young Dr. Benner looked down upon her. He
had not given so much thought of late to the development
of his protégé. He had met in the county
seat an older lady who had taken his fancy, who
needed no improvement, and whose mind was
already sufficiently developed to suit his ideas. He
looked now at Katy through narrowed eyelids. He
suddenly remembered the great plans he had had
for her and the greater plans she had had for herself.
He began to wonder what Katy&#39;s life would be like,
he who had just a little while ago been planning it
so carefully! He heard in that instant&#39;s pause a
clear whistle from the direction of the garden, and
he decided without knowing the identity of the
whistler that there would sooner or later be that
sort of complication in Katy&#39;s life which would end
her education, even if her grandmother&#39;s need of
her did not. He was so busy with his speculations
that he did not answer Katy&#39;s question until she
was faint with apprehension.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy was a sensitive creature; she was suddenly
aware of the changed, absent way in which he
regarded her. She remembered that it was a long
time since the doctor had invited her to ride with
him, a long time since he had said anything to her
about singing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My gran&#39;mom is all I have in this world,&quot; she
reminded him with piteous dignity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Katy.&quot; The doctor came back to reality
with a start. &quot;She will not die.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
His expression terrified Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then, when will she be well again?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The whistle sounded again from beyond the garden
wall. This time it penetrated to the consciousness
of Katy, who, hearing it, blushed. No one but
Alvin Koehler could produce so sweet and clear a
note. For the first time he had called her. The
night was warm and bright, and the breeze carried
the odor of honeysuckle and jasmine into the kitchen.
The beauty of the night seemed mocking. Katy&#39;s
heart cried out angrily against the trouble which
had come upon her, against the greater grief which
now threatened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean that she will be sick a long, long time?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Possibly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy clasped and unclasped her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You do not mean that perhaps she will never be
well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not believe she can ever be well, Katy.&quot;
The doctor now laid his hand on Katy&#39;s shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy moved away, her hand on her side, as if to
sustain the weight of a heavy heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What am I to do for her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor gave directions about the medicines,
and then went across the yard to sit with the squire
in his office. When he had gone, Katy stood for a
moment perfectly still in the middle of the room.
The whistle did not come again; Alvin, approaching
the house without knowing anything of Grandmother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
Gaumer&#39;s illness, saw suddenly that the
house was more brightly lighted than usual and stole
away.</p>

<p class="indent">For an instant Katy stood still, then she crossed
the room and opened the door which led into the
dim front of the house, and went into the parlor.
There she sat down on the high, slippery haircloth
sofa. Presently she turned her head and laid her
cheek against the smooth, cool surface of the arm.
Overhead she could hear the sound of Uncle Edwin&#39;s
soft, heavy tread, the sound of his deep voice as
he spoke to Grandmother Gaumer or to Aunt Sally.
Uncle Edwin was a good man, Katy said to herself
absently, her mind dwelling upon a theme in which
it took at that moment no interest; Uncle Edwin
was a good man, but he was not a very smart man.
He had never gone to school&mdash;to school&mdash;Katy
found herself repeating that magic word. It brought
fully into the light of consciousness the dread
question which had been lingering just outside. If
Grandmother Gaumer were to be a long time sick,
who would take care of her? Uncle Edwin and Aunt
Sally were kind, but they had their farm on the
outskirts of Millerstown; they could not leave it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I must have my education,&quot; whispered
Katy to the smooth surface of the old sofa. &quot;This
is my time in life for education. Afterwards the
mind gets dull, and you cannot learn. It is right
that I should have a chance to learn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Katy sat up; from the room above Uncle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
Edwin called her. &quot;Ach, Katy, come once here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am coming,&quot; answered Katy as she flew.</p>

<p class="indent">In the sick-room her uncle and aunt welcomed her
with relief. To them Katy was always a sort of
wonder child. They had wanted to adopt her when
she was a little girl; they had always loved her as
they loved their own little Adam.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We cannot make out what she wants, Katy.
Perhaps it is you she wants.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy looked about the room, at the stout, disturbed
uncle and aunt, then at the great bedstead,
with its high feather bed, its plump pillows. Grandmother
Gaumer&#39;s hair had been covered by a close-fitting
cap; the sheet was drawn up under her chin;
she seemed to have shrunk to a pair of eyes. But
they were eyes into which the life of the body was
concentrated. Katy almost covered her own as she
met them, her throat contracted, all emotions combined
into one overwhelming sensation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will stay here now,&quot; announced Katy. &quot;Aunt
Sally, you can go home, and Uncle Edwin, if he is
to stay all night here, can go to bed, and if I need
anything I will call him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus Katy, the dictator. When they had obeyed,
Katy crossed the room to her grandmother&#39;s side.
To such an interview as this there could be no witnesses.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No one else is going to take care of you, gran&#39;mom,&quot;
promised Katy. &quot;No one can travel so fast
and talk so much.&quot; She leaned over and laid her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
hand on her grandmother&#39;s cheek. &quot;I am going to
stay with you to-night and to-morrow night and
always. I am never going to leave you. I care for
schooling, but I care more for you. You raised me
from little when I had no father and mother to take
care of me. I will remember what you said about
gran&#39;pop, and I will try to be like him. <i>Do you
understand me?</i>&quot; besought Katy in a sudden agony
of fright.</p>

<p class="indent">The brown eyes answered, or Katy thought they
answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then,&quot; said Katy. &quot;Now I will read you a
chapter and then you will go to sleep.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br/>
KATY FINDS A NEW AIM IN LIFE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was on Tuesday evening that Grandmother
Gaumer was smitten and Alvin Koehler whistled in
the garden. On Wednesday Millerstown flocked to
the Gaumer house with inquiries and gifts. They all
saw Grandmother Gaumer, according to Millerstown&#39;s
custom in sickness, then they went down to
the kitchen to hear from Bevy an account of this
amazing seizure. Sarah Ann Mohr, who was one of
grandmother&#39;s oldest friends, brought fresh pie and
many tears. Susannah Kuhns promised fresh bread
in the afternoon, and Sarah Knerr carried off the
washing.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Sarah Ann, accustomed to hear with admiration
and wonder the problems which Katy put to a
puzzled Mr. Carpenter, and expecting, with the rest
of the community, that she would bring extraordinary
honor to Millerstown, asked Bevy Schnepp a
question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My mom was taken that a way,&quot; she explained,
tearfully. &quot;For seven years she laid and didn&#39;t
speak and toward the end she hadn&#39;t her mind any
more. Who will take care of gran&#39;mom? Will Edwin
and Sally move home or will they get some one from
outside?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
Bevy stood beside the sink, her arms akimbo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gran&#39;mom isn&#39;t sure to lie seven years,&quot; said
she. Bevy had in her possession the seventh book
of Moses, which contained many powerful prescriptions;
she meant to see what pow-wowing could do
before she despaired of Grandmother Gaumer. &quot;But
if she does lay, Edwin won&#39;t come home and they
won&#39;t get anybody from outside. It was never
yet a Gaumer what had to be taken care of by
one from outside. Katy will take care of her gran&#39;mom.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy will take care of her gran&#39;mom!&quot; repeated
Sarah Ann. &quot;But she won&#39;t be well till [by] September!
How will Katy then be educated? Carpenter
has learned her everything he knows in this
world. I could easy hear that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy does not think of education,&quot; answered
Bevy. &quot;She thinks of nothing but her gran&#39;mom.
She is with her night and day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Solemnly Sarah Ann and Bevy regarded one
another. Then solemnly they nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is what I said to Millerstown!&quot; Thus
Sarah Ann in triumph. &quot;There are those in Millerstown
who will have it that Katy will let her gran&#39;mom
stick. There are those in Millerstown who say
that when people get education, they get crazy.
Did she cry, Bevy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not that I saw,&quot; answered Bevy, proudly. &quot;Or
that any one else saw, I guess.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will tell Millerstown,&quot; Sarah Ann made ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
to depart. &quot;It is three places where I will stop
already on my way home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ponderously, satisfied with her darling, Sarah
Ann moved through the door.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the numerous visitors was Essie Hill, who
had recently experienced the sudden and violent
change of heart which admitted her to full membership
in the Improved New Mennonite Church. She
wore now a little short back sailor like the older
women, with an inscription across the front to the
effect that she was a worker in the vineyard. Essie
was sincere; she was good, but Katy hated her.
When she told Essie, not without a few impertinent
embroideries, that her grandmother was asleep,
Essie departed with a quiet acceptance of the rebuff
which no Millerstonian would have endured without
resentment. Essie&#39;s placid soul, however, was
not easily disturbed. She performed her duty in
offering to sit by Grandmother Gaumer and to read
and pray with her; further she was not obligated.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy heard no more Alvin&#39;s clear whistle in the
garden. She said to herself, in a moment of physical
and mental depression, that he might easily have
made a way to see her by coming with the rest of
Millerstown to inquire for the invalid; then she
reminded herself that the Koehlers went nowhere,
had no friends.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is ashamed of his pop,&quot; said Katy to herself.
&quot;His pop is a black shame to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On Thursday she left her grandmother while she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
went on an errand to the store and her eyes searched
every inch of Main Street and the two shorter
streets which ran into it. But Alvin was nowhere to
be seen. She answered shortly the questions about
her grandmother, put to her by the storekeeper and
by all other persons whom she met, and returned to
the house in despair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I could only see him,&quot; she cried to herself.
&quot;If I could only talk to him a little!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On Sunday evening Bevy drove her out, almost
by force, to the front porch. Bevy&#39;s preacher was
again holding services in the next village, and Bevy
was therefore free to care for the invalid. She had
sought all the week an opportunity to sit by Grandmother
Gaumer and to repeat the pow-wow rhymes
which she firmly believed would help her. Now,
sitting at the head of the bed in the dusk, she made
passes in the air with her hands and motions with
her lips. When she was certain that Grandmother
Gaumer slept, she slid down to her hands and knees
and crept three times round the bed, repeating the
while some mystic rhyme. In reality, Grandmother
Gaumer did not sleep, but lay amusedly conscious
of the administrating of Bevy&#39;s therapeutic measures.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Katy was not alone. Had Bevy suspected
the company into which she was sending her
beloved, it is probable that one spring would have
carried her down the steps, and another to the
porch.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
Katy sat for a long time on the step with her chin
in her hands. She was thin, her eyes were unnaturally
large, the hard work of nursing had worn her
out. Her gaze searched the street, and she shrank
into the shadow of the honeysuckle vine when
couples paraded slowly by, arm in arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have nobody,&quot; mourned Katy, weakly, to
herself. &quot;Nobody in all the world but my gran&#39;mom,
and she cannot even speak to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After a long time Katy&#39;s sharp gaze detected a
lurking figure across the street. Her heart throbbed,
she leaned forward out of the shadow of the vine.
Then she called a soft &quot;Alvin!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin came promptly across and Katy made room
for him beside her. He wore his new red tie, but his
face as the light from the street lamp fell upon it
was far from happy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is your gran&#39;mom yet sick?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot; Katy could answer only in a monosyllable.
Alvin was here, he sat beside her, the skirt of her
dress rested against him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was here once in the garden, and I whistled for
you. I did not know your gran&#39;mom was sick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I heard it, but I couldn&#39;t come.&quot; The two
voices had all the tones of deep tragedy. &quot;It was
when my gran&#39;mom was first taken sick.&quot; Katy felt
suddenly tired and weak, but she was very happy.
She noticed now the odor of honeysuckle and the
sweeter jasmine out on the garden wall. It was a
beautiful world.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
After a long time Alvin spoke again, still unhappily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;David Hartman is going away to school.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy&#39;s heart gave a jealous throb. It was not fair
for any one to have an education when she could not.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is going right away to the real college.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He cannot!&quot; said Katy. &quot;He cannot pass the
examination. He is no farther than I and I couldn&#39;t
get in the real college. I guess we have catalogues
that tell about it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But there is a young fellow here to teach him
this summer, so he can get in. His mother is willing
for him to go. Some say that David has already his
own money. It costs a lot of money to get such a
young man. He gets more than Carpenter got, they
say. He is living at the hotel because it is too clean
at the Hartmans&#39; for strangers. David goes to him
at the hotel. They say he will learn to be a lawyer
so that he can take care of his money. And the
tailor&quot;&mdash;the spaces between Alvin&#39;s words grew
wider and wider, his voice rose and fell almost as
though he were chanting&mdash;&quot;the tailor is making
new clothes for him, and his mom bought him a
trunk in Allentown!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So!&quot; said Katy, scornfully, the blood beating in
her temples. She did not envy David his clothes,
but she envied him his learning. Katy was desperately
tired; a noble resolve, though persisted in
bravely, does not keep one constantly cheerful and
courageous.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
&quot;And he sits on the porch in the evenings sometimes
with Essie Hill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has good company! It is queer for such an
educated one to like such a dumb one! Perhaps
Essie will get him to convert himself. She was here
to get me to convert myself. She says it is while I
am wicked that this trouble comes upon me. She
wanted to sit by my gran&#39;mom and talk about my
gran&#39;mom&#39;s sins, and I told her my gran&#39;mom
hadn&#39;t as many sins in her whole life as she had
already.&quot; Katy could not suppress a giggle. &quot;That
settled her. I wouldn&#39;t even let her go up. I wanted
to choke her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again Katy sat silently. Alvin was here, she was
consuming the time in foolish talk; at any minute
Bevy might descend from above or they might be
interrupted by a visitor. Alvin moved uneasily.
Perhaps he, too, felt this talk to be foolish. The light
fell full upon his red tie and the beautiful line of his
young throat. A more mature and experienced person
than Katy Gaumer would have been certain
that there must be good in a creature so beautiful.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;David can go to college,&quot; he said mournfully.
&quot;But I cannot go anywhere, not even to the normal
school where I could learn to be a teacher. I thought
I would surely get that much of an education, but
there is no hope for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy turned and looked at him. &quot;Why no hope?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, they say in Millerstown that you are not
going to school. You said that when you went to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
school you would find a way for me to go. But if you
are not going, then there is no one to help me. And
pop&quot;&mdash;Alvin&#39;s lapses into the vernacular were frequent&mdash;&quot;pop
gets worse and worse. He is going
very fast behind. He is getting so he has queer ideas.
He was making him shoelaces with the ravelings of
the carpet. And he thinks there is now a woman
with horns after him. He talks about it all the time.
I have nothing in this world. When he was so bad
I came to tell you. It was then I whistled.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You do not need any one at the school to help
you,&quot; said Katy in a clear voice. &quot;If I am not going,
I can all the better help you to go; don&#39;t you see
that, Alvin? If you are going to teach, you do not
have to pay anything except for board and room.
I have two hundred dollars in the bank, and I can
lend you some to begin with and then you can get
something to do. I will give you fifty dollars&quot;&mdash;poor
Katy planned as though she had thousands.
&quot;There is a little hole round the corner of the house
in the wall, where Bevy used to put the cakes for me.
There I will put the money for you, Alvin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin&#39;s lips parted. He felt not so much gratitude
as amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to school <i>ever</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy did not answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Millerstown will be crazy when it finds I am
going away!&quot; cried Alvin with delight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They must never know how you go!&quot; said Katy
in alarm. &quot;You must not tell them how you go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
&quot;They think my father has money.&quot; Here was a
solution. &quot;They do not know he has given it all to
detectives. They think he has it hidden away.
Millerstown is very dumb.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must get a catalogue from the school,
Alvin, and you must send in your name. That is the
first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will,&quot; promised Alvin. &quot;I will do it right away.
It is a loan, Katy, and I will pay it back. It will not
be hard to earn the money to pay it back!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sound of a descending footstep on the stairway
frightened them, as though they had been plotting
evil. Alvin went swiftly and quietly out the
brick walk, and Katy sat still. When Bevy came to
the kitchen door, Katy sat on the lowest step, where
Bevy had left her, her elbows on her knees, her chin
in her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not to come in yet,&quot; said Bevy. &quot;I just
came to get a drink. Your gran&#39;mom is sleeping.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, well,&quot; answered Katy, keeping her voice
steady by great effort. She did not wish to move.
She wished to think and think. If Alvin had omitted
an expression of thanks, she held no grudge against
him, had not, indeed, even observed the omission.
Here was an outlet from prison; here was something
to be, to do! She would cheerfully have earned by
the labor of her hands enough to send Alvin Koehler
to school. After such a foolish, generous pattern
was Katy made in her youth; thus, lightly, with a
beating, happy heart, did she put herself in bondage.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
&quot;I will educate Alvin,&quot; said Katy. &quot;If I cannot
do one thing, I can do another.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin Koehler climbed the hill. His heart did not
throb as rapidly as Katy&#39;s, but Alvin, too, was very
happy. Alvin was not yet possessed by an overwhelming
desire for an education; but he saw a new
suit and at least three neckties. Above that delectable
goal, his ambition did not rise.</p>

<p class="indent">When he reached the little white house on the
hillside and lifted the latch of the door, he could not
get in. After he had pounded and called, his terror
growing each moment greater, he tried the window.
From there his father&#39;s strong hands pushed him so
suddenly that he fell on his back into the soft soil
of the garden. Poor William Koehler had come to
confuse the woman with horns with his harmless son.</p>

<p class="indent">Terrified, Alvin retraced his steps to the village
and sought the squire. In the morning, the squire,
with gentle persuasion, carried poor William to the
county home. There William was kept at first in a
cell, with a barred window; then he was allowed
to work in the fields under guard. Gradually, the
woman with horns vanished; his work with his
familiar tools and with the plants which he loved
seemed to have a healing effect. He grew more and
more quiet; presently he ceased to pray aloud in his
frantic way. He said after a while that God had told
him to be quiet. He seemed to have forgotten his
home, his child, his old life, even his enemy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII<br/>
KATY BORROWS SO THAT SHE MAY LEND</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">In</span> June Grandmother Gaumer was smitten; in
September Alvin was to go away; the months between
were not unhappy for Katy. Occasionally
Alvin came and sat with her on the porch in the
darkness. It was tacitly agreed that they should not
be seen together. Public opinion in Millerstown was
less favorable than ever to Alvin since his father&#39;s
removal to the poorhouse was coincident with Alvin&#39;s
elaborate preparations for school. Alvin could not
wait for the slow operations of a tailor; he went at
once to Allentown and purchased a suit; the fifty
dollars which he found at the time appointed in the
putlock hole remained intact no longer than the time
consumed in making the journey. Millerstown was
certain that Alvin had found his father&#39;s hoarded
wealth, and speculated wildly about its possible
size.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Koehler was working all these many years,&quot;
said Susannah Kuhns. &quot;He had all the time his
place free on the hill. Alvin will have enough money
for education, of that you may be sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But can he take education?&quot; asked the puzzled
Sarah Ann. &quot;The Koehlers were always wonderful
dumb. There was once a Koehler whose name was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
Abraham and he wrote it always &#39;Aprom,&#39; and one
made a cupboard and nailed himself in and they had
to come and let him out. They are a dumb Freundschaft.
They are bricklayers and carpenters; they
are not educated men. Now, with Katy it is different.
She has a squire and a governor in her Freundschaft.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe he got all this money from his
pop,&quot; protested Bevy. &quot;There are other ways of
getting money. It says in the Bible, &#39;Like father,
like son.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He parades up and down like a Fratzhans [dude]
in his new clothes,&quot; said Susannah.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ach, Susannah!&quot; reproved gentle Sarah Ann,
in whose judgment criticism had now gone far
enough.</p>

<p class="indent">Such speculations and accusations Katy had more
than once to hear. Then Katy clenched her hands.
They would see Alvin come back to Millerstown
some day a great man. She hated Susannah and
Bevy and all Alvin&#39;s detractors. Never was Katy
doubtful for an instant of her undertaking; she had
succeeded with the Christmas entertainment; she
had succeeded in compelling Mr. Carpenter to teach
her; she was succeeding now in doing all the work
in her grandmother&#39;s house; she would succeed in
educating Alvin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sarah Ann is a great, fat worm,&quot; said Katy with
scorn. &quot;When the brains were given out, Sarah
Ann was missed. And Bevy is a little grasshopper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
and she, too, is dumb. It is a great pity for
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She wished that she might see Alvin oftener, but
that was impossible. He was near at hand; she
could get occasional glimpses of him, and she could
sit by her grandmother&#39;s bed and think of him. She
had put her precious fifty dollars in the putlock hole
and Alvin had removed it. It must be confessed
that between the time Katy promised and the time
that she deposited the money, Alvin came more
than once after night to feel round in the improvised
bank. The gift constituted now in Katy&#39;s mind
an unbreakable bond between them. Such largess
would have inspired her to lay down her life for the
giver, and Alvin was endowed in her mind with gifts
and graces far greater and nobler than her own. At
the garments which he bought she looked with
tender approval. Certainly he could not go to the
normal school without suitable clothes!</p>

<p class="indent">Besides Katy&#39;s clearly expressed conviction that it
was unwise for Alvin to come to see her, there was
another reason why Alvin did not turn his steps
oftener to Grandmother Gaumer&#39;s gate. Alvin&#39;s
new clothes put him temporarily into a condition
bordering upon insanity. He must show himself in
his fine apparel. He would have liked to appear in
it each evening, but such a performance was unthinkable.
Only on Saturday and Sunday did Millerstown
wear its best.</p>

<p class="indent">On Saturday and Sunday, therefore, Alvin lived.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
He attended ice-cream festivals and Sunday School
picnics; he went diligently to church, selecting each
Sunday the one of Millerstown&#39;s churches which
was likely to have the largest attendance. When
the Lutherans had a Children&#39;s Day service, Alvin
went early to get a good seat. Often he sat in
the Amen corner, close to the little cupboard with
the space of smooth, gray wall beside it. Upon the
smooth, gray wall his profile and curly head cast a
beautiful shadow. When there was a revival service
at the church of the Improved New Mennonites,
Alvin was in the congregation. There he was conscious
of the demure eyes of Essie Hill. Essie was
always alone. David Hartman, who sat with her
on the doorstep, never was seen inside her church.
To David revivals, such as enlivened many of the
meetings of the Improved New Mennonites, were
intolerable; they made him feel as he had felt at
his father&#39;s funeral with the gaze of all Millerstown
searching his soul. Between Essie and her father
there had occurred a short conversation about
David and his worldly ways.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can never marry outside your church,
Essie,&quot; said grave, sober Mr. Hill.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, pop,&quot; agreed Essie. &quot;Such a thing I would
not do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin Koehler would have had no objection to a
scrutiny of his soul. To Alvin, all of himself was
interesting.</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin did not think often of his father. By this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
time William was trusted to work in the almshouse
fields, and was allowed to talk from morning till
night of his wrongs.</p>

<p class="indent">Early in September Alvin went away. He came
on the last Saturday evening to say good-bye to
Katy and they sat together on the dusky porch.
The porch was darker than it had been in the springtime,
since the hand which usually pruned the vines
was no longer able to hold the shears. There were
still a few sprays of bloom on the honeysuckle and the
garden was in its greatest glory. There bloomed scarlet
sage and crimson cock&#39;s-comb and another more
brilliant, leafy plant, red from root to tip. Among
the stalks of the spring flowers twined now nasturtiums
and petunias, and there was sweet alyssum
and sweet William and great masses of cosmos and
asters. In the moonlight Katy could see a plant
move gently; even in her sadness she could not resist
a spasm of pleasure as a rabbit darted out from
behind it. On the brick wall between the porch and
the garden stood Grandmother Gaumer&#39;s thorny,
twisted night-blooming cactus with great swollen
buds ready to open to-morrow evening. The air had
changed; it was no longer soft and warm as it had
been the night when Katy first planned to educate
Alvin.</p>

<p class="indent">Sitting by her grandmother&#39;s bed Katy had finished
her red dress with the ruffles. It had been
necessary to make the hem an inch longer than they
had planned in the spring. Grandmother Gaumer&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
patient eyes had seemed to smile when Katy showed
her. Grandmother Gaumer was shown everything;
to her bedside Bevy bore proudly Katy&#39;s first successful
baking of bread; thither to-morrow, Uncle
Edwin would carry the great cactus in its heavy tub.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy sat for a long time on the step before Alvin
came. Her body softened and weakened a dozen
times as she thought she heard his step, then her
muscles stiffened and her hands clenched as the step
passed by. Presently it would be time for Bevy to
go home and for Katy to go into the house, or presently
some one would come, and then her chance to
see Alvin would be gone. It seemed to her that
Bevy looked at her with suspicion when Alvin&#39;s
name was mentioned; the later it grew the more
likely Bevy was to interrupt their interview.</p>

<p class="indent">The grip of Katy&#39;s hands, one upon the other,
grew tighter, her cheeks hotter, the beating of her
heart more rapid. He must come; it was incredible
that he could stay away. Her throat tightened; she
said over and over to herself, &quot;Oh, come! come!
come!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Presently down the dusky street approached
Alvin with his swinging walk. Now Katy knew at
last that she was not mistaken. He was here; he
was entering the gate which she had opened so that
its loud creak might not be heard by Bevy; he was
walking softly on the grass as Katy had advised
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin sat down a little closer to Katy than was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
his custom. A subtle change had come over him.
Though the Millerstown boys looked at him with
scorn, the Millerstown girls, smiling upon him, had
completed the work which Katy&#39;s attentions had
begun. Alvin had not attended Sunday School picnics,
with their games of Copenhagen and their long
walks home in the twilight, for nothing. Alvin had
less and less desire for learning; he still thought of
education as a path to even finer clothes than he
had and greater admiration and entire ease. He had
come now from service at the Lutheran church, and
from his favorite corner he had been conscious of the
notice of the congregation. He had asked Katy for
twenty-five dollars more than she had given him;
this, Katy told him, lay now in the putlock hole in
the house wall. His spirits rose still more gayly as
he heard of it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will pay it back in a year or two,&quot; he assured
Katy lightly. &quot;Then I will tell you how to do when
you go to school.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Katy. She would have liked to say,
&quot;Oh, Alvin, keep it, keep it forever!&quot; But how then
should she attain to an equality with Alvin? She
realized now fully that he was going away. The
long, long winter was fast approaching, and she
would be here alone in this changed house. There
would be no more entertainments; there would be
no more frantic racing with Whiskey; there would
be no more glorifying, sustaining hope.</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly the tears rolled down Katy&#39;s cheeks. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
knew that the minutes were passing rapidly, and
that she and Alvin had said nothing. But still she
sat with her hands pressed against her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Almost immediately, alas! there was an alarming
sound. The step of Bevy was heard descending the
stairway. Poor Katy could cheerfully have slain
her. A hundred confused thoughts filled her mind,
the tears came faster than ever; she rose, and Alvin
rose with her and they looked at each other, and
then Alvin was gone. In his excitement he closed
the gate noisily behind him. Katy sank down again
on the step from which she had risen. When Bevy
looked out from the doorway, Katy sat motionless.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ought to come in, Katy,&quot; advised Bevy.
&quot;It is cold.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not cold,&quot; said Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is damp and cold,&quot; insisted Bevy. &quot;I thought
I heard the gate slam.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy made no answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did it slam?&quot; asked Bevy.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy looked round. Her eyes were bright; her
voice, if it trembled, did not tremble with grief. &quot;If
you heard it, I guess it slammed,&quot; said she.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The night air is bad.&quot; Bevy was losing patience.
&quot;<i>Will</i> you come in?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">Bevy snapped the screen door shut.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Je gelehrter, je verkehrter&quot; (The more learned,
the more perverse), she declared.</p>

<p class="indent">When Bevy had reached the upper hall, Katy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
rose from her place on the lowest step, and stretched
out her arms as though to embrace the garden and
Millerstown and the world. Mist was rising from
the little stream below the orchard; it veiled the
garden in a lovely garment; it seemed to intensify
the odor of the honeysuckle and the late roses.
Again Katy sank down on the step and hid her face
in her arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He kissed me!&quot; said Katy shamelessly.</p>

<p class="indent">Now Katy&#39;s winter was guarded against unhappiness.</p>

<p class="indent">A little later in September David Hartman went
to school also, not to the normal school where tuition
cost nothing, but to college as befitted the heir
of a rich man. His tutor had prepared him thoroughly
for his examinations; he had an ample
allowance; there was no reason why the gratification
of any legitimate desire should be denied him. His
mother had spared no pains with his outfit; she had
bought and sewed and laundered and packed a
wardrobe such as, it is safe to say, no other student
in the college possessed. During the long summer
she and David had had little to say to each other.
David had been constantly busy with his books;
he had had little time even to think of his father,
whom he so passionately regretted. Death continued
to work its not uncommon miracle for John Hartman;
it dimmed more and more for his son the character
of his later years, and exaggerated greatly the
vaguely remembered tendernesses of David&#39;s babyhood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
John Hartman had to an increasing degree
in his death what he had not had in life, the affection
and admiration of his boy. How was it possible for
him to be anything else but silent with a wife so
cold, so immovable, so strange? David was certain
that he had solved his father&#39;s problem. Sometimes
David could not bear to look at his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">But now that he was going away, David&#39;s eyes
were somewhat sharpened. His mother looked thin
and bent and tired; she seemed to have grown old
while she sewed for him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ought to get you a girl,&quot; he said with the
colossal stupidity of youth and of the masculine
mind.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hartman looked at him, as though she were
suddenly startled. He seemed to have grown tall
overnight; his new clothes had made a man of him.
Then a film covered her eyes, as though she withdrew
from the suggestions of lunacy into some
inward sanctuary where burned the lamp of wisdom.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A girl!&quot; cried Cassie, as though the suggestion
were monstrous. &quot;To have her spoil my things!
A girl!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David&#39;s trunk was packed in the kitchen, thither
his hat and satchel were brought also. When his
breakfast was over he went down the street to the
preacher&#39;s for a letter recommending his character.
When he returned, his trunk and satchel had been
sent to the station; he had now only to take his hat
and say good-bye to his mother who was at this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
moment in the deep cellar. For her David waited
awkwardly. He remembered how he had stood
kicking his foot against the door sill on Christmas
Day&mdash;how many years and years ago it seemed!</p>

<p class="indent">Now, as then, David experienced a softening of
the heart. He forgot his resentment against his
mother&#39;s coldness, against her strange passion for
material things. She was his mother, she was all he
had in the world, and he was going away from her
and from his home. He heard her ascending the
cellar steps, and he turned and went up to his room
as though he had forgotten something, so that he
might hide his tears.</p>

<p class="indent">At the entrance of the little hall which led to his
room, David stood still, the lump hardening in his
throat, his breath drawn heavily. His errand to the
preacher&#39;s had not taken half an hour, but in that
half-hour his room had been dismantled. The cheap
little bed had been taken apart and had been carried
into the hall; the carpet had been dropped out of the
window to the grass below; broom and scrubbing-brush
and pail waited in the corner. The door of his
mother&#39;s room opposite his own was closed; a dust
cloth was stuffed under it so that no mote could
enter. Now, all the rooms in Cassie&#39;s house except
the kitchen and her own could be immaculate.</p>

<p class="indent">For a long moment David stood still. He looked
into his room, he looked at his mother&#39;s closed door,
he looked at the door which shut off the deep front
of the great house. He felt the same mysterious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
impression which Katy Gaumer felt when she looked
at the outside of the Hartman house, as though it
held within it strange secrets. It seemed now as
though it thrust him forth as one who did not
belong, as though its walls might presently contract
until there should be no space for him to stand. It
was a cruel suggestion to a boy about to leave his
home! David breathed deeply as though to shake
off the oppression, and then went down the steps.</p>

<p class="indent">Without apparent emotion he bade Cassie farewell,
then strode briskly toward the station. Essie
Hill, who let him sit beside her on the doorstep and
who argued prettily with him about his soul, was
nowhere to be seen; his companions, Ollie Kuhns
and Billy Knerr and the Fackenthals, were at work
or at school; Bevy Schnepp, whose great favorite he
was, was busy with her washing in the squire&#39;s yard
far up the street. In the door of the store stood Katy
Gaumer. Her, with Alvin Koehler, he hated. David
had with his own eyes beheld one of Alvin&#39;s hasty
departures from Grandmother Gaumer&#39;s gate. Persons
found their levels in this world and Katy had
found hers.</p>

<p class="indent">But on the corner David hesitated. How tall she
had grown! How large her eyes were, and how lacking
in their old sparkle! Cheerfully would he have
returned in this final moment of madness to the
dullness of the Millerstown school to be near her
once more, cheerfully would he have continued his
abode in Millerstown forever. He determined to go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
to speak to her, to say, &quot;Let us be friends.&quot; Essie
Hill was pretty and sweet, and her anxiety about
his soul was flattering, but Essie was like a candle
to a shining star. He saw the flirt of Katy&#39;s red
dress as she sailed up the schoolroom aisle; he heard
her saucy answers to the teacher; he admired her
gayety, her great ambition. She had planned by
now to be at school, learning everything; instead,
she wore a gingham apron and stood in the Millerstown
store buying a broom!</p>

<p class="indent">A single step David had already taken, when
Katy turned from her bargaining and their eyes met.
Katy knew whither David was bound; already his
train whistled faintly at the next station. It seemed
to her that he looked at her with pity. He was to
go, and she was to stay&mdash;forever! With bitterness
Katy turned her back upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">For a year Grandmother Gaumer lay high upon
her pillows, her patient eyes looking out from her
paralyzed body upon her friends and her quiet
room. Presently she was able to lift her hands and
to say a few slow and painful words. Her bed had
been moved to the parlor; from here she could look
up and down the street, and out to the kitchen upon
Katy at her work. A trolley line was being built to
connect Millerstown with the county seat; she could
see the workmen approaching across the flat meadows,
and after a while could watch with a thrill a
faint, distant gleam of light broaden into the glare
of a great headlight as the car whizzed into the village.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
Her face grew thinner and more delicate; her
survival came presently to seem almost a miracle.
But still she lay patiently, listening to the storms
and rejoicing in the sunshine. To her Katy read
the Bible, hour after hour, a dull experience to the
mind of Bevy, devout Improved New Mennonite
though she was.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are an old woman,&quot; protested Bevy. &quot;You
are older than I in your ways. Run with Whiskey
a little like you used to run! I could be much oftener
here, and the other people would be glad to sit with
gran&#39;mom. I even put cakes for you in the hole and
you don&#39;t take them out any more!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy was really very happy during the long
winter. Housekeeping had become easy; she would
accept no help even with washing and cleaning.
As for going about in Millerstown, Katy laughed, as
neat, aproned in housewifely fashion, she sat by her
grandmother&#39;s bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I go now to quiltings and surprise parties
when I would not go before? I am not interested in
those things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Often there was time in the long afternoons for
Katy to sit with her books. She knew what Alvin
was studying; it was easy at first to keep up with
him. She enjoyed the sense of importance which her
position as head of the house gave her. Sarah Ann
dissolved in tears as she praised her; Uncle Edwin
and Aunt Sally made much of her. And how much
more important was she than any of them knew!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
Alvin was doing well at school, at least so Alvin
wrote. When trouble came, she would have Alvin to
fly to. When her tasks seemed a burden, or when
studying without a teacher became difficult, or when
the winter storms shook the house, she remembered
how he had kissed her. The complication which
Dr. Benner had feared for Katy had arrived. Dr.
Benner was by this time married; in the glamour
in which he lived, he was unconscious of the existence
of Katy except as a person of whom questions
must occasionally be asked, to whom directions
must sometimes be given. His wife was not pleasant
and &quot;common&quot;; she was &quot;proud&quot;; she gave Millerstown
to understand that as soon as she could
persuade her husband to buy a practice in a more
cultivated community, they would leave.</p>

<p class="indent">At Christmas time Alvin did not come home, but
went instead to visit a schoolmate. If he had come,
there would have been no place for him to stay. The
little house on the mountain-side was cold and
deserted; it would probably never be occupied again.
Alvin wrote occasionally to Katy and Katy wrote
regularly to him. It was not to be expected that he
should neglect his work to write letters. Fortunately
the Millerstown post-office was presided over
at present by old man Fackenthal, who did not
scrutinize addresses with undue closeness. Nevertheless,
Katy disguised her own hand and dropped
her letters into the slit in the door at night.</p>

<p class="indent">David returned at Christmas time with an added
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
inch of height, with straighter shoulders and a
sterner glance. David moved swiftly, answered
questions directly, walked alone upon the mountain-side,
or sat with his books in his mother&#39;s kitchen.
He seemed to have had some improving, enlightening
experience; college had already done a great deal
for him. Him Katy did not see.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor did Alvin appear in the summer time, except
for a few days at the end. He had asked Katy for
another fifty dollars in the spring, and she had sent
it to him without stopping to consider that now
more than half of her money was gone. Alvin meant
to work in a drug store this summer, at least so
Alvin said, in order to pay part of his debt. But the
dispensing of soda water did not appear to have
been as profitable as he expected, for in August,
when he came to Millerstown, he borrowed another
fifty dollars. He promised certainly now that he
would come for Christmas. He put his arms boldly
round Katy and kissed her many times. It seemed
that Alvin, too, had had illuminating experiences.</p>

<p class="indent">David spent the summer in his little room and on
the mountain-side. David sometimes lay for hours
together on the plateau before the Sheep Stable.
Sometimes he carried thither the books which he
continued to study diligently. Sometimes he walked
about, climbing among rocks, tramping along the
arched back of the little range of hills,&mdash;mountains,
to Millerstown. David sighed contentedly
and breathed deeply. He noted the dappled shadows,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
the wreathing clematis, the tall spikes of lobelia,
the odor of slippery elm the first reddening branch
of the gum trees. He looked down upon the fertile
fields, upon the scattered villages, and he was almost
happy. Then David returned to his books. It was
strange that he should study so earnestly during the
long summer. Surely David with his good mind
had not fallen behind his fellows!</p>

<p class="indent">David&#39;s illuminating experiences had not been
entirely those which study and knowledge bring.
David&#39;s arrival in the college town had been at once
observed and marked. He towered above his fellows;
he had a look of greater maturity than his years
would warrant; he had apparently large means at
his command. Upper classmen are not so entirely
devoted as is supposed to the abuse of the entering
novice. Upon the novice depends the continued
existence of the college society which is so important
a part of the college&#39;s social structure. You cannot
very well urge a man to join an organization of
which you are a member after you have beaten him
or held his head under an icy hydrant! David&#39;s
college made a tacit but no less real distinction
between the youth who was likely to prove valuable
society material and the youth who would likely
prove to be merely a student. David&#39;s clothes were
of the best, he had many of them, he occupied an
expensive room; it was evident that he need not
have recourse to the many shifts by which the poor
boy in college provides himself with spending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
money. David was overlooked in the disciplinary
measures by which many of his classmates were
trained to respect their betters. His discipline was,
alas! much harder to endure!</p>

<p class="indent">He accepted in his silent way the attentions which
were showered upon him, the drives, the treats, the
introductions to foolish young ladies whose eyes
spoke their admiration. David was bewildered and
embarrassed, and David for a time wisely remained
silent. There was no reason to think that David
had not been brought up in the politest of society.
But, finally, alas! David spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not often that a student had a party
given especially for him. But, as the seven villages
struggled for the honor of the birth of Homer, so
the college societies longed for the honor of possessing
David. Finally all but two dropped out
of the race. David had not committed himself to
either, but it was understood that in accepting the
proffered entertainment he was practically making
his decision.</p>

<p class="indent">The great evening approached; the great guest in
his fine apparel, another new suit, now a dress suit
made by the college tailor, appeared at his party.
The prettiest girl of all appointed herself his companion,
and to him addressed a pretty remark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are glad to have you here at college, Mr.
Hartman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then David spoke. The prettiness of the girl, the
formality of her address, the bright lights, his conspicuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
position&mdash;all combined in David&#39;s downfall.
David did not speak naturally as he spoke
now; David had no trouble with <i>th</i>, David knew the
English idiom; David knew better, oh, much, much
better. But poor David reverted to type.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I sank myself,&quot; said David amid a great and
growing hush. Then David walked out, away from
the pretty girl, away from the bright lights, away,
forever, from the organization which had sought
him. Overwhelmed with embarrassment, outraged,
David sought his room and his books. David could
never be persuaded to return to the society in which
he had been thus humiliated; he never emerged
again from his room or his books except to recite or
to walk or to go to his meals or to church. He
henceforth lived alone. He discovered that by diligent
study he could accomplish in three years what
he had expected would require four. The sooner
he was out of this place the better. He went weekly
to a neighboring city, and there, finding a teacher
of elocution, conquered, he was sure forever, that
damning trick of speech. He grew handsomer; he
filled his room with beautiful furniture and many
books; his allowance assumed in the eyes of his college
mates the proportions of a fortune in itself. But
David could not be induced to forget. David lost
much, but David in his sullen hermitage remained
decent and unspoiled.</p>

<p class="indent">Once or twice in the summer he sat with Essie on
her doorstep. Essie was prettier than ever; she still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
besought him to be &quot;plain.&quot; David laughed at her
and teased her; she was really the only person in
the world with whom he laughed. His mother&#39;s
strength seemed to have failed; often she lay down
on the settle before it was dark, but only when she
fell asleep did David find her in this ignominious
position. If she heard a step she sprang up, as
though she had committed a crime.</p>

<p class="indent">Once more Christmas approached and passed.
This time again there was no visiting governor, no
great feast, no entertainment. Again Alvin did not
come home; he did not now write a letter or send a
gift. Grandmother Gaumer was worse; the patience
in her eyes had changed to a great weariness; she
had ceased to be able to move or to speak.</p>

<p class="indent">In March there came a great storm. It extinguished
all the village lamps; it whirled across the
broad breast of the mountain, sending to the
ground with a mighty crash, unheard of man, many
trees; it beat against the Gaumer house, which
seemed to tremble. In spite of the storm, however,
Katy put on her scarlet shawl and went to the post-office,
as of old. But in those days there had been no
such feverish haste as this!</p>

<p class="indent">Her grandmother looked at her for a moment as
she stood by the bed and tried to smile. Then Katy
went out, her skirts flying in the wind, the rain
beating in her face. She plodded along as best she
could, without the old sensation of a viking breasting
an angry sea.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
At the post-office she found a letter, and there
stopped to read it because she could not wait.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear, dear Katy!&quot; With what a wild thrill
Katy beheld the opening words. Then Katy read on.
&quot;I am in great trouble, Katy. For some time I have
not had enough money to get along, and now I must
have fifty dollars. Oh, Katy, try and get it for me!
Oh, I don&#39;t know what will happen, Katy. Oh,
please, Katy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy read the letter through twice; then she stood
gaping. Old man Fackenthal spoke to her and she
answered without knowing what she said; then she
went out and stood in the rain, trying to think.
She had no money; her last cent had been given to
Alvin in the fall. But Alvin had appealed to her to
help; it was&mdash;oh, poor Katy!&mdash;an honor to be
thus solicited. No one else could help him; he would
go to no one else in the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Like a shock of cold water upon an exhausted
body, fell Alvin&#39;s request upon Katy&#39;s weary, tired
soul. When the necessity for an English entertainment
was made clear to Katy, plans were immediate,
execution prompt. Katy had known at once
what she would do. She forgot now that she had no
way of earning money; she did not anticipate that
to her honest soul the burden of a debt would be
almost as great as the burden of remembered theft.
Boldly she presented herself to the squire in his
office and there made her request. Nothing was
plain to Katy except Alvin&#39;s bitter need.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
The squire looked at her in astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a good deal of money, Katy!&quot; But the
squire had seen Katy at her books. &quot;You need
books, I suppose, and things to wear. I see you
studying and sewing, Katy. You are not to slip
back in your studies before you go away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will give you a paper and I will pay interest,&quot;
promised Katy, who did not wish to discuss the
spending of the money.</p>

<p class="indent">The squire went slowly to his safe. It must be
very dismal for the child. His poor sister-in-law was
not likely to improve, and she might, alas! be a long
time dying. If the situation were not changed by
fall, the child must be sent away and Edwin must
come home to live. He remembered his own bright
little sister; he remembered the plans of all the
family for Katy. A sudden remorseful consciousness
that they had forgotten Katy, and that they
had left a good many burdens on her shoulders,
moved him to give her the foolish sum for which she
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This I <i>give</i> you, Katy,&quot; said he as he counted
the money into her hand. It was not strange that
the squire had taken so few journeys.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; protested Katy with a scarlet face; &quot;it is
a debt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Recklessly Katy slipped the money into an envelope
and mailed it, and Alvin, receiving it, wept for
joy and thought with gratitude of the sender. The
small part of it which he did not have to use to pay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
his most pressing debts he spent upon a girl from
the county seat, one Bessie Brown, who had visited
a friend at the normal school, and for whom he had
great admiration.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br/>
EMPTINESS</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> great March storm seemed to clear the way for
an early spring. The winter had been unusually
cold and long; even honeysuckle and ivy vines were
winter-killed. The great old honeysuckle vine on
the Gaumer porch died down to the ground and
hung a mass of brown stems, through which the
wind blew with a crackling sound. Day after day
Millerstown had had to thaw out its pumps. To
Sarah Ann Mohr, who had once read an account on
the inside pages of the Millerstown &quot;Star&quot; of the
delicate balance of meteorological conditions, the
signs were ominous.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It means something,&quot; insisted Sarah Ann.
&quot;Once when my mom was little they had such a
winter and then the snow fell in June on the wheat.
The wheat was already in the head when the snow
fell on it. If it gets only a little colder than that,
the people die.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But spring returned. Sarah Ann beheld with a
thankful heart the hyacinths and narcissus in her
flower beds pushing their heads through the soil,
the rhubarb sprouting in her garden; she breathed
in with unspeakable delight the first balmy breeze.
Sarah Ann&#39;s friends were slipping rapidly away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
from her; she was one of the last survivors of her
generation; but her appetite was still good, her step
firm, her eye bright. Sarah Ann was a devout and
trustful Christian, but she had never been able to
understand why a heaven had not been provided
on the beautiful earth for those who were worthy.</p>

<p class="indent">The dogwood put out earlier than usual its shelf-like
boughs of bloom; before the end of April bluets
starred the meadows round the Weygandt dam,
and everywhere there was the scent of apple blossoms.
Grandmother Gaumer&#39;s garden, with its
vine-covered wall, its box-bordered paths, its innumerable
varieties of flowers, was a place of magic.
Though its mistress was away, it had never been so
beautiful, so sweet.</p>

<p class="indent">In it Katy walked up and down in the May twilight.
She moved slowly as though she were very
idle or very tired, or as though no duties waited her.
Her face was white; in the black dress which she
had had made for her grandfather&#39;s funeral and
which her grandmother had persuaded her to lay
away, she seemed taller and more slender than she
was.</p>

<p class="indent">Each time she turned at the end of the garden
walk, she looked at the house and then away quickly.
She did not mean to look at all, but involuntarily
she raised her eyes. The parlor windows behind
which Grandmother Gaumer&#39;s lamp had shone so
long were blank. In the room above, which had
been Grandfather and Grandmother Gaumer&#39;s there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
was now a light. Every few seconds the light was
darkened by the shadow cast by the passing to
and fro of a large figure. From the same room came
the sound of a child&#39;s voice, the little voice of &quot;Ehre
sei Gott&quot; in the Christmas entertainment long ago.
Now it was raised in cheerful laughter. In the
kitchen, Edwin Gaumer sat by the table, a page
of accounts before him. There were now more persons
in the house than there had been since Katy
had been taken there as a baby, but the house
was, nevertheless, intolerably lonely. Grandmother
Gaumer&#39;s life was ended; she had been laid beside
her husband in the Millerstown cemetery. She had
had a long life; she had outlived almost all those
whom she had loved, even all her children but one;
she needed no mourning.</p>

<p class="indent">But Katy sorrowed and would not be comforted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was all I had. I have a few other friends like
the squire and Sarah Ann, but these are old, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy walked more and more slowly along the
garden path. Even her grandmother&#39;s death had
brought from Alvin no letter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot understand it,&quot; whispered Katy to
herself; &quot;I cannot understand it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed to Katy that there was no subject in
the world upon which her thoughts could rest comfortably,
no refuge to which her weary, sorrowful
soul could flee. During her grandmother&#39;s illness,
she had dreamed of Alvin, of his progress at school,
of the time when he should come home and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
should plan together. He had kissed her again and
again; she belonged to him forever. But why, oh,
why did he not write? There was for poor Katy
only anxiety and humiliation in the world.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I am in debt!&quot; she mourned. Her constant
reading of the Bible to her grandmother had furnished
her with quotations for all the experiences
of life. It was a textual knowledge which many
preachers would have envied her. It gave her now a
vehicle with which to express her woes. &quot;I am like
David in the cave,&quot; said she. &quot;I am in distress and
in debt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fifty dollars!&quot; whispered Katy as she walked
up and down the garden paths. &quot;I am fifty dollars
in debt!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was true that the squire had insisted that the
money must be a gift. But the squire had not the
least suspicion of the purpose to which his gift had
been devoted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They have nothing for Alvin,&quot; said Katy to
herself. &quot;Alvin has had no chance. He will surely
pay it back to me. I am certain he will pay it
back!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The dew fell damp about her, but still Katy
walked on and on, up and down the garden paths.
When, finally, she went into the kitchen, her Uncle
Edwin looked up at her blinking. In his rugged face
was all the kindness and sober steadfastness of the
Gaumers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit down once, Katy,&quot; said he, neither in command
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
nor in request, but with gentle entreaty. &quot;I
want to talk to you a little.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy sat down on the edge of the old settle. She
would listen to no condolences; every fiber in her
body bristled at the first sign of sympathy. Sympathy
made her cry, and she hated to cry. Katy
hated to be anything but cheerful and happy and
prosperous and in high hope.</p>

<p class="indent">Several minutes passed before Uncle Edwin
began upon his subject. Though he loved Katy, he
stood in awe of her, gentle and weak though she
appeared in her black dress.</p>

<p class="indent">His first question was unfortunately worded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you going to do now, Katy, that
gran&#39;mom is gone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy looked at him sharply. She was not well;
she was worried and unhappy; she found it easy to
misunderstand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For my living, you mean?&quot; said Katy, cruelly.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Edwin gazed, open-mouthed at his niece.
He would have been ludicrous if he had not been so
greatly distressed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ach, Katy!&quot; protested he, in bewilderment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Edwin had at that moment not the faintest
idea of what he meant. He hesitated for an instant,
then he stammered out an answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean, Katy, when are you going to school?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The room swam round before Katy&#39;s dull eyes.
School! She was never going to school; she could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
not go to school. But a more acute anxiety threatened;
the moment when she must give an account
of her two hundred dollars was probably at hand.
Katy&#39;s very heart stood still.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not going to school,&quot; said she.</p>

<p class="indent">Again Uncle Edwin&#39;s mouth opened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, you are, Katy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean&quot;&mdash;wildly Katy seized upon any
weapon of defense she could grasp: it was easy to
confuse Uncle Edwin&#39;s mind&mdash;&quot;do you mean when
am I going away from here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now Uncle Edwin&#39;s blue eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ach, Katy!&quot; cried he. &quot;We are only too glad to
have you. You know how I wanted to take you
when you were a little baby, and Aunt Sally wanted
you. This is your home forever, Katy. But you
always talked so of school and education!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not care for education.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Edwin&#39;s head shook with the activity of the
mental processes within it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What!&quot; he exclaimed, incredulously. Then he
took a fresh start. Katy&#39;s ill-temper was incomprehensible,
but when she heard what his plans were,
she would be cross no longer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have two hundred dollars in the bank,
Katy. The two hundred that the governor sent you
a while back, haven&#39;t you, Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He did not ask the question for information, but
to establish the points of his simple discourse.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Katy, faintly, from her agitation.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
&quot;That is a good start. Now the squire will help
and I will help. We have this all arranged between
us. Then, when you come of age you will get the
money your gran&#39;mom left you. But that you are
not to touch for your education. That you will
leave by me, because I am your guardian in the law.
You were faithful to your gran&#39;mom till the end,
and you are not to spend your own money for education.
The squire and I will look after that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The muscles of Katy&#39;s face had stiffened and
utterance was impossible. All the old, dear, eager
hope filled her heart. But Alvin was still precious
to her; her sacrifice had been made for him; the
sacrifice whose extent she was just beginning to
understand. This, however, was no time to think of
Alvin. She forced herself to say again quietly that
she was not going to school.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not&mdash;going&mdash;to&mdash;school!&quot; cried Uncle Edwin
with long pauses between his words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; repeated Katy. &quot;I am not going to
school.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Katy sought her room and her bed.</p>

<p class="indent">When Uncle Edwin reported his interview with
Katy to the squire, the squire laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ach, she just talks that way! She is a little
contrary, like all the women when they are tired or
not so well. Of course she is going! She was in here
not long ago talking about it and I gave her some
money for books and other things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The next day the squire himself spoke to Katy.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
&quot;Are you getting ready for school, Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not going to school.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Since when have you changed your mind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This long time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The squire turned and looked at Katy over his
glasses.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, it is only a little while since I gave you
money for books!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You didn&#39;t give me money,&quot; corrected Katy,
stammering. &quot;It was a loan; I said it was a loan.
Else I wouldn&#39;t have taken it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humbug, Katy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">If the squire had been Katy&#39;s guardian, she would
have gone promptly to school. But Uncle Edwin
held that office and he could not have brought himself
to compel Katy to do anything. The squire
argued and coaxed and cajoled and Katy looked at
him with a white face and stubborn eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It wasn&#39;t right to take the two hundred dollars
from Daniel in the beginning if you didn&#39;t intend
to use it for schooling, Katy. What <i>are</i> you going
to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to earn my living,&quot; answered Katy.
Her debt to the squire was swelling to tremendous
proportions; and there was also the much greater
sum for which she could give no account. Katy
was sick at heart. But she managed to end the
interview lightly. &quot;I&#39;m going to earn money and
save it, and be a rich, rich woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Once safely out of the squire&#39;s office, Katy walked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
up the mountain road. She must be alone, to think
and plan what she must do. School? Her whole
body and mind and soul longed for school. But she
could never go to school. She must pay the squire
his fifty dollars. Suppose he should ask her to show
him the books and dresses she had bought! She
must also replace the whole two hundred before they
found her out. She could see the expression of amazement
and disgust on the face of the squire at the
mere suspicion of any close friendship between a
Gaumer and a Koehler. People despised Alvin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But they have no right to,&quot; cried Katy. &quot;I
want to see Alvin. He will make it right, I am sure
he will make it right. He is older than I!&quot; Katy
spoke as though this fact were only now known to
her. &quot;He has no right&mdash;&quot; But Katy went no
further: her love had been already sufficiently
bruised and cheapened. &quot;I have tied myself up in
a knot! I have done it myself!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy looked down upon the Hartman house.
Rumor said that Mrs. Hartman was failing; the
rare visitors to her kitchen found her on the settle
in midday.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is nothing but dying in the world,&quot; mourned
Katy. &quot;We grow up like grass and are cut
down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Katy had now no time to think of the Hartmans.
She went on up the mountain road until she
reached the Koehler house. The walls needed a coat
of whitewash, the fences were brown, the garden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
was overgrown. It was a mean little place in its
disorder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He never had a chance,&quot; protested Katy in
answer to some inward accusation. Then Katy went
drearily home.</p>

<p class="indent">By the first of June Alvin had still not written;
by the end of June Katy was still looking for a letter.
The term of the normal school had closed; it was
time for him to be at home. Surely he could not
mean to stay away forever!</p>

<p class="indent">Day after day Katy&#39;s relatives watched her solicitously,
expecting her grief to soften, her old spirits
to return; day by day Katy grew more silent, more
depressed. Uncle Edwin now attacked her boldly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you forget how smart the governor thought
you were, Katy?&quot; Or, &quot;It was bad enough for your
gran&#39;mom that you couldn&#39;t go to school for two
years, Katy, but this would be much worse for
her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In July Uncle Edwin took fresh courage and
began to reproach her. If she was going to school,
no time must be lost, they must make plans, she
must have an outfit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;David Hartman is at home,&quot; said he. &quot;He will
be very learned. He is smart. But he is not so
smart as you, Katy. Do you forget how you were
up to him in school and he is older than you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy swallowed her coffee with a mighty effort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Alvin Koehler was here to-day,&quot; went on
Uncle Edwin. &quot;He wants that the directors should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
give him the Millerstown school, now that Carpenter
is no longer here. We think he should have it while
he comes from Millerstown. He has made a good
deal of himself. You would be surprised to see him.
But you are much smarter than he, Katy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy put up her left hand to steady her cup.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he gets the school, he is going to get married,&quot;
went on Uncle Edwin placidly. &quot;It is a girl from
away. I am surprised that Alvin had so much sense
as to study good and then settle down and get married.
He said he had such an agency in the school
for hats and neckties and such things. That was
how he got along. There is, I believe, a good deal
more in Alvin than we thought. But you, Katy&mdash;Why,
<i>Katy</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy had risen from the table, her face deathly
pale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have burned myself with coffee,&quot; said she.</p>

<p class="indent">Simultaneously Uncle Edwin and Aunt Sally and
little Adam pushed back their chairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ach, Katy, here; take water, Katy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; protested Katy, &quot;it is not so bad as that.
But I will go and lie down a little. My head hurts
me, too. I am tired and it is very hot. I will go to
my room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Stammering, Katy got herself to the stairway.
There, having closed the door behind her, she started
up the steps on hands and knees. At the top she sat
down for a moment to rest before she crept across
the room to her bed. Again it was an advantage to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
be &quot;Bibelfest,&quot; she had once more an adequate
vehicle for the expression of her woes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am like Job,&quot; wept poor Katy. &quot;I am afflicted.
I am a brother to jackals and a companion to
ostriches.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Once when Katy opened her eyes, she saw opposite
her window a single, pink, sunset-tinted cloud
floating high in the sky. Somehow the sight made
her agony more bitter.</p>

<p class="indent">Down in the kitchen Uncle Edwin, alarmed, confused,
distressed, found himself confronted by an
irate spouse. He could not remember another occasion
in all their married life when his Sally had lost
patience with him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, pop,&quot; said she, &quot;it is enough. You are to
leave poor Katy be.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br/>
KATY PLANS HER LIFE ONCE MORE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">For</span> a long time Katy lay motionless upon her bed.
The shock of Uncle Edwin&#39;s announcement was
overwhelming; it robbed her of power to move or
think. When an hour later Aunt Sally tiptoed into
the room, she found her still upon her bed, her face
buried in the pillow, relaxed in what seemed to be a
heavy sleep. Aunt Sally gathered her clothes from
the untidy heap into which they had been tossed,
and laid them on the back of a chair and drew down
the shade so that the sun should not shine directly
into the sleeper&#39;s eyes; then she closed the door
softly and went down the steps.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy did not stir until the sun had vanished
behind the western hills and the stars were shining.
Then she rose and bathed her face and sat down by
the window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must think,&quot; said Katy. &quot;I must now plan
out my life in a new way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Stubbornly she forced herself to face the event
which made necessary this fresh planning of her life.
Beyond the event itself she did not at this moment
proceed. She beheld Alvin with his red tie, Alvin
with his dark curls, Alvin with his beautiful olive
skin, Alvin with his great, expressive eyes. Sitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
by her window with the soft evening air blowing in
her face, the odors of the garden rising sweetly about
her, Adam&#39;s gentle, laughing voice, and all the other
pleasant sounds of the Millerstown evening in her
ears, Katy wept.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Elend (Misery)!&quot; cried she, after the manner
of Millerstown in trouble.</p>

<p class="indent">After a while the voice of pride made itself heard.
It was not Alvin whom she defended, but herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No word of marrying was said between us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he kissed you,&quot; reminded the inward voice.
&quot;You thought he would marry you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To this Katy could return only the answer of
flaming cheeks and a throbbing heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And there is all the money you gave him!&quot;
reminded the voice within her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I said he needn&#39;t pay it back!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you expected him to pay it back!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he needn&#39;t!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An honorable person would pay it before he got
married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has no money! He has nothing to pay it
with!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He had an agency for neckties! He has enough
to get married!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed to Katy that a ring of queer faces
mocked her. She had eaten only a mouthful of
supper, and she was a little light-headed. She
seemed to see clearly the &quot;lady from away&quot; of
whom her uncle had spoken. Imagination, helped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
by recollection of the beautiful ladies in the Allentown
stores, pictured her clearly. She was brilliant
and beautiful and learned, and she dressed marvelously.
She was probably an acquaintance whom
Alvin had made at school; she was all that Katy
longed to be.</p>

<p class="indent">Now there rushed upon Katy a new and terrible
sensation. She had been envious of David Hartman
because he was going away to school, but here was
a new kind of envy which affected not only the
mind but the whole being. She threw herself down
on her bed once more and hid her face in the pillow
and wept with deep, sobbing gasps.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently, the paroxysm of crying over, Katy
rose once more and once more dashed cold water over
her burning cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will not cry another tear,&quot; said she with stern
determination. &quot;I will now plan my life. I must
first earn the fifty dollars to pay back the squire;
that is certain. Beyond that is nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing
in this world. My young life is ruined.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For an hour Katy sat by the window, her chin in
her hands. Frequently tears dropped to the window
sill, but she gave way to sobs no more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My heart is broken,&quot; declared Katy. &quot;But I
must live on. I will probably live to be a thousand
years old. I wish I was with my good gran&#39;mom in
heaven. I wish&quot;&mdash;said Katy presently, with a
long sigh&mdash;&quot;I wish I had been born into this world
with sense.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
By the time that the house had quieted for the
night and the sounds of Millerstown&#39;s going about
had ceased, Katy, too, was asleep. She stirred uneasily
on her pillow, her hands now clasped under a
scarlet cheek, now flung above her head. But she
had outlined her working theory.</p>

<p class="indent">In the morning she appeared in good time for her
breakfast. She had not been refreshed by her restless
sleep, but the first sharpness of the blow was
past. In the doorway of the kitchen stood Bevy,
her bright eyes sparkling with curiosity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is this I hear about Koehler&#39;s boy?&quot; she
asked Edwin Gaumer. &quot;Is it so that he will have
the Millerstown school?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It looks that way,&quot; answered Uncle Edwin.
&quot;He is a normal, and he has good letters from the
normal about his work, and he comes from Millerstown
and we should help our own; and besides
nobody else wants the Millerstown school.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A Koehler teaching!&quot; Bevy raised her hands in
an astonished gesture. &quot;He is the first Koehler that
ever knew more than A B C. The school board will
get into trouble. This will never go. Where will he
live?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will rent a house. He is getting married after
school takes in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Married!&quot; shrieked Bevy. The suspicion that
friendly relations existed between Katy and Alvin
had grown to certainty. Now, furious as Bevy had
been because Katy had so lowered herself, she resented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
Alvin&#39;s daring to attach himself to any one
else. &quot;What cake-not-turned will have him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A lady from away. I think she comes from Allentown.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have right to say from away,&quot; sniffed Bevy.
&quot;No girl from here would look twice at him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy turned her back upon Bevy as she lifted the
breakfast from the stove to the table. Sharp stabs
of pain pierced her. She would have to hear a dozen
times that day that Alvin was to be married. The
strain of listening to Bevy&#39;s comments was almost
more than she could endure. It had been important
before that no one should suspect that she was helping
Alvin; now it had become absolutely imperative.</p>

<p class="indent">When breakfast was over, Katy started down the
street to carry out her plan of life. Her dress was
longer than was becoming, the spring had gone out
of her step. She passed the store and the post-office
and turned up Church Street, and there beheld
approaching the object of her journey, who started
visibly at sight of her. David had grown still taller;
he wore still more elegant clothes; he would have
found an even more cordial welcome to the societies
of his college than would have been extended to him
upon entering. He was certain that he could be
graduated in June of the next year, and he was
pleasantly aware of his position as the most wealthy
and the most reserved student in college. David
liked the distinction. His speech was now entirely
English; he was certain that it would be impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
for him to blunder again. He had determined that
when he had graduated he would travel; he would
never live for many months at a time in dull Millerstown.
David added another adjective to Katy&#39;s
characterization of that busy, tidy village; he called
it <i>bourgeois</i>. David had, indeed, soared high above
the low plane of his origin! He had found among
the few books in the Hartman house the pictures of
Paris and Amiens and Canterbury, and had learned
for the first time that his father had been abroad.
The mystery of his father was thereby deepened.
There was only one portion of David&#39;s heart which
had not hardened; in that his father was enthroned.
His father, he was convinced, had had great powers,
but he was held to earth and to Millerstown by a
cruel fate which had linked him forever to an unworthy
companion. Thus had Cassie&#39;s son decided
against her.</p>

<p class="indent">David was astonished to hear Katy call to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come here, please, David. I want to talk to
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He crossed the street at once and stood looking
down at her. He could not help seeing, even though
he had relegated Katy forever to obscurity in
Millerstown, that Katy had not become altogether
unattractive. Her eyes no longer sought his brightly,
she looked down or past him as he came toward her.
He wondered what possible errand she could have
with him. He felt his face flushing and he was furious
with himself.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
&quot;How are you, Katy?&quot; said he, his voice sounding
strangely in his ears.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy did not hear his question. Her thoughts
were fixed upon the plan of life.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to speak to you about something, David.
I was going to your house. The doctor said your
mother was not well. I heard him say to the squire
that she would have to have a girl to live with her
when you went back to school. I would like the
place, David.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David&#39;s eyes nearly popped from his head. It
was true that his mother seemed feeble and that he
had been making inquiries about a maid for her.
But by such an offer as this he was dumbfounded.
Had Katy lost her mind? No Gaumer had ever
worked out. Her relatives were comfortably fixed;
she would doubtless have some money of her own
when she came of age. Where was Alvin Koehler,
the despicable, to whom Katy had seemed attached?
Had he heard her aright? He could only look at her
and gasp out a foolish, &quot;<i>You!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can work,&quot; said Katy, with a scarlet face.
&quot;I did all the work when my grandmother was sick
for so long.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you not going to school?&quot; David grew more
and more astonished as he became convinced that
Katy was in earnest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not going to school,&quot; said Katy. &quot;If I
cannot get a place to work at your house, I will get
a place somewhere else, that is all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
&quot;Are you in any trouble, Katy?&quot; asked David.
&quot;Can I do anything for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy&#39;s head lifted. David Hartman was pitying
her, asking to be allowed to help her. It was intolerable.
She realized now how tall he was, how deep
his gray eyes, how fair his white skin; she remembered
her gingham apron, her debt, her disappointed
hopes, every embarrassment and pain that had
befallen her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is nothing wrong, of course,&quot; said she
coldly as she turned away. &quot;That is all I wanted of
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but wait!&quot; David went to her side and kept
pace with her. He did not proceed with his speech
at once. The old vision dazzled him, Katy in a
scarlet dress, Katy laughing, Katy racing down the
pike. It was abominable for her to become a servant&mdash;upon
this subject, also, David&#39;s opinions had
advanced. What in the world were her relatives
about? But if she must live out, it would be better
for her to work for his mother than to work at the
hotel&mdash;the only other establishment in Millerstown
which required the services of a maid. He would
then have her in his house; the notion set David&#39;s
cheeks suddenly to burning, his heart to throbbing.
He wondered what room his mother would give her,
where she would sit at the table, what she would do
in the evenings when her time was her own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you want to engage me?&quot; asked Katy,
sharply; &quot;or don&#39;t you want to engage me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
&quot;My mother will be only too glad to have you,&quot;
said David, eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will come when your school opens,&quot; promised
Katy, as she turned the corner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I get a dollar and a half a week,&quot;&mdash;the
standard of wages in Millerstown was not high,&mdash;&quot;it
will take me thirty-three and a third weeks to
save fifty dollars,&quot; reckoned Katy. &quot;That will take
from September till June. After that I do not think
of anything. Perhaps by that time I will die. Then
I do not care if they find out that I haven&#39;t my two
hundred dollars any more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy at home went on with her accustomed tasks.
She was silent; she avoided her aunt and uncle,
since any sudden, gentle address made her certain
that she was going to cry. She put little Adam down
whenever he wished to climb up beside her on the
settle; she was to every one a trying puzzle. In her
nervousness she had often a desire to stand still and
scream.</p>

<p class="indent">One evening the squire came into the Gaumer
kitchen. Edwin lay on the settle asleep, his wife sat
by the table sewing, little Adam was long since in
bed. Katy, too, had gone upstairs. Forgetting now
that she had announced her intention of going to
bed immediately, she left her place by the window
to go down for a drink, and came face to face with
the squire who was entering. The squire looked
grave; he seated himself in Grandfather Gaumer&#39;s
armchair as though he meant to hold court. In a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
flash Katy knew what he had come to say. Uncle
Edwin sat up blinking, Aunt Sally dropped her
sewing into her lap. The squire did not often pay
calls so late in the evening.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy,&quot; began the squire in a stern voice, &quot;what
is this I hear about you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy&#39;s hand was still upon the latch of the stairway
door; she grasped it for support. She had
thought that she was prepared for the coming interview,
but she was now badly frightened. Never
before had the squire spoken to her with anything
but gentleness and affection.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you hear about me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Benner came in just now on his way from Cassie
Hartman&#39;s. He had been trying to find a girl for
her. She said that now she would not need one, that
you were going to hire out to her in September.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Edwin blinked more rapidly. Aunt Sally&#39;s
lips parted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot; said Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is this thing so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Katy, bravely. &quot;There is
nothing wrong in it. It is honest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are going to hire out!&quot; cried Edwin.</p>

<p class="indent">Aunt Sally began to cry. These tears were not
the first she had shed on Katy&#39;s account.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What <i>for</i>?&quot; demanded Uncle Edwin. &quot;You
have a home. I told you we would send you to
school. You need not even touch your money. What
is this, Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
&quot;I want to earn my living, that is all.&quot; Katy&#39;s
voice was dry and hard. &quot;It is surely my right to
earn my living if I want to!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Earn your living if you must!&quot; said the squire,
gruffly. &quot;Of course you can earn your living if you
want to. But go to school and learn to earn it
right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not want to go to school.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The squire looked at her helplessly. Then he
crossed the room and took her by the shoulders and
seated her on the settle between Edwin and himself.
He was a persuasive person; it was hard for any
one to deny him what he commanded or what he
requested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy, dear, are you in any trouble?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy actually prayed for help in her prevarication.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is Edwin and here am I,&quot; went on the
squire. &quot;We are strong enough to do up anybody.
Now, what is the matter, Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing,&quot; insisted Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You once wanted to sing,&quot; Aunt Sally reminded
her. &quot;You were wonderful strong for singing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sing!&quot; echoed Katy. &quot;I, sing? I can only caw
like a crow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had such plans,&quot; said Uncle Edwin. &quot;You
were going to be so educated. You were going to
bring home your sheaves!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have more sense now,&quot; explained Katy.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
She looked at them brightly. Her eyes measured
their broad shoulders&mdash;how she longed to lay her
heavy burden upon them! She no longer belonged
to her kin, she was an alien; she had allied herself
with Koehlers, with William Koehler who was a
thief, with Alvin Koehler who scorned her. She
would sooner die than tell what she had done. The
Gaumers were not niggardly, but they knew the
value of money. Even Katy had learned that it
took thirty-three and one third weeks to earn fifty
dollars!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must let me be!&quot; she burst out wildly. &quot;I
am not a child. I have no father and mother and my
dear grandfather and grandmother are dead. You
must let me be! You are persecuting me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In an instant the stairway door closed in the faces
of her astonished elders. Uncle Edwin got out his
handkerchief and wiped his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Millerstown will think we are ugly to her,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not care what Millerstown thinks,&quot; declared
the squire as he rose to go. &quot;It is what <i>I</i>
think. In the name of sense what has come over the
girl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In her room Katy threw herself once more upon
that oft-used refuge, her bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I could forget him,&quot; she moaned. &quot;If I only
could forget him. It is not right to think of him. I
cannot be learned, but I can be good. It is wrong to
think all the time of him.&quot; She remembered various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
women in the village who loved inconstant, unfaithful
men. &quot;I am a Mary Wolle! I am Sally Hersh!
I am a shame to myself!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Three times before September the squire reasoned
with her. Even the doctor ventured to remonstrate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No Gaumer has ever done such a thing before,
Katy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you,&quot; said Katy with spirit, &quot;are not a
Gaumer, so you do not need to care.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At her Bevy stormed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You surely have one rafter too few or too many,
Katy. There is something wrong with your little
house! <i>Are</i> you crazy, Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Katy, thus nearly paralyzing
Bevy Schnepp. &quot;I am.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In September Katy took up her abode at the
Hartmans&#39;. Millerstown saw her go with wonder.
She carried a little satchel and walked with her chin
in the air. Millerstown gazed out doors and windows
to see whether the thing it had heard could be true.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ach, Katy!&quot; protested Sarah Ann, &quot;are you not
going to be high gelernt?&quot; Sarah Ann suspected
some difficulty at home; her sympathetic soul was
distressed for Katy. &quot;You can come any time and
live with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Won&#39;t you ever go to your uncle any more?&quot;
asked Susannah Kuhns, her frank inquiry voicing
the curiosity of Millerstown.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy turned and faced them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, certainly I will. I will go there every day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
Alvin Koehler had opened the Millerstown school
and had already rented a house from William Knerr
the elder. Katy saw him almost daily; he had even
stopped her on the street to tell her that he had not
forgotten her. He exuded satisfaction with himself
from every pore; he would even have told her about
his Bessie if Katy had lingered for an instant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is not so good-looking as she once was, Katy
isn&#39;t,&quot; said Alvin as he looked after her.</p>

<p class="indent">David Hartman had gone when she reached his
mother&#39;s house. Mrs. Hartman lay upon the settle
in the kitchen. Her face was pale; she sat up with
difficulty when Katy came in. She knew little of
the affairs of Millerstown; she did not speculate
about the reasons for Katy&#39;s presence in her house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a long time since my house was cleaned
right,&quot; she complained. &quot;We must begin at the top
and clean everything. To-day, though, we will clean
David&#39;s room. That is where you are to sleep. You
can first scrub the cupboards and dust the books
and put them away in the cupboard. He has many,
many books and they gather dust so. Then stuff a
dust-cloth tight under the door while you clean the
rest. And take the bed apart so you can dust it
well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hartman lay down, breathless. The Gaumers
had the reputation of being fine housekeepers; she
hoped that her house would again be restored to
cleanliness. Her son, with his untidy, mannish ways,
was gone; peace had returned.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
By Saturday Katy had become acquainted with
the attic of the great house, the house which in her
childhood had been to her the abode of Mystery.
The attic, with its store of discarded but good
furniture, its moth-guarded chests, was clean; it
had been swept, whitewashed, aired, scrubbed,
made immaculate. Each garment had been carried
down to the yard, had there been beaten and sunned,
and then had been restored to its proper place.
Cassie, making her painful way to the third story,
pronounced the work good. The next week the
bedrooms were to be similarly treated. Into their
magnificence Katy had peered, round-eyed. Here
was no mystery, here was only grandeur. Thus Katy
would have furnished her house.</p>

<p class="indent">On Saturday evening when work was done, Katy
went down to sit with Aunt Sally. She was desperately
tired; such toil as Cassie Hartman directed
had not come within the Gaumer experience. But
Katy was happier; that was plain even to the eyes
of Aunt Sally, who shook her head over the strange
puzzle. Katy had had no time for thinking. And
into the putlock hole she had dropped a dollar and
a half. The putlock hole was a safe bank; only a
small hand like her own could reach into the inner
depths into which she thrust her precious earnings.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV<br/>
AN OLD WAY OUT OF A NEW TROUBLE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of the 1st of September, Alvin
dressed himself handsomely and went out the pike
to the schoolhouse. The school board had, at his
request, advanced his first month&#39;s salary, and with
a part of it, though he was not to be married until
January, he had paid the rent of the little house on
Main Street, and with the rest he had bought a present
for Bessie. It must be confessed that no generous
spirit dictated Alvin&#39;s giving of gifts. It was a
proper thing to give girls presents, thereby one made
an impression upon them and upon their friends.
But it also deprived the giver of luxuries. Alvin had
begun to anticipate eagerly the time when he would
no longer need to make presents to Bessie.</p>

<p class="indent">Bessie was a saleswoman in a store in a county
seat; she received good wages and lived at home.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What I earn is mine,&quot; she explained. &quot;My pop
buys even some of my clothes for me. I need only buy
my fancy clothes. I have a nice account in the bank.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bessie was a thrifty soul; she had made Alvin
persuade his landlord, Billy Knerr, the elder, to take
two dollars a month less than he had asked at first
for the little house. She had planned already the
style of furniture she wished for each room.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
&quot;It is to be oak in the dining-room,&quot; Alvin explained
to Sarah Ann Mohr, with whom he took his
meals. Alvin had reached that point in his self-satisfaction
when he would have bragged to stones
and trees if there had been no human creature at
hand to listen. In Sarah Ann he had an eager hearer.
Sarah Ann sat at close attention with parted lips
and shining eyes. Sometimes she cried out, &quot;Du
liefer Friede&quot; (Thou dear peace)! or, &quot;Bei meiner
Seele&quot; (By my soul)!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is to be a sideboard and a serving-table
to match,&quot; went on Alvin.</p>

<p class="indent">Sarah Ann opened her mouth a little wider.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is a serving-table, Alvin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A serving-table is a&mdash;it is&mdash;a&mdash;a table,&quot;
explained Alvin. &quot;You serve on it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, of course,&quot; said Sarah Ann, without understanding
in the least. &quot;I am astonished, Alvin!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are just going to furnish two bedrooms now.
When we have a servant, then it will be time enough
to furnish the other room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarah Ann&#39;s eyelids fluttered up and down.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A servant! Ach, Alvin, I hope you are not going
to marry a sick one!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course not,&quot; protested Alvin. &quot;Of course not,
Sarah Ann!&quot; Alvin&#39;s chest expanded, he breathed
deeply. &quot;Ladies in the city do not do their own
work, Sarah Ann!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ladies!&quot; repeated Sarah Ann. Here was the
capstone of Alvin&#39;s grandeur. A lady was to Millerstown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
almost a mythical creature. &quot;Are you, then,
marrying a lady, Alvin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To be sure,&quot; answered Alvin. &quot;She never yet
had to work in a kitchen. She is in the store just
because she likes it. Her pop is rich.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean she cannot cook, Alvin? Or wash?
Or bake?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She could,&quot; said Alvin. &quot;She could if she wanted
to. But she doesn&#39;t like it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doesn&#39;t like it!&quot; As well might one say that
Bessie did not like to sleep or eat or breathe! Sarah
Ann&#39;s own breath was quite taken away. She shook
her head ponderously, certain that either she or
Alvin was going crazy. Then a question occurred
to Sarah Ann. She had really a delicate sense of
propriety; if she had stopped to think, she would
not have asked the question. But it was out before
she could restrain herself. &quot;You will then bring your
pop home from the poorhouse, I suppose, Alvin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin blushed. He did not like to have any one
mention his father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father is not in the poorhouse because he is poor.
He is there because he has lost his mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ach, Alvin, he is better, <i>indeed</i>, he is better! I
was at the poorhouse to help with a prayer meeting,
and, indeed, he is almost himself, Alvin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin rose from his seat on Sarah Ann&#39;s bench.
The conversation had taken a turn he did not like.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could not have pop with Bessie,&quot; he insisted.
&quot;Pop could easily become violent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
When he had left her, Sarah Ann sat paralyzed.
Her whole soul longed for the listening ear of
Susannah Kuhns, but as yet her body had not
gathered strength enough to transport itself to
Susannah&#39;s house. Mercifully, the fates arranged
that Susannah should observe the departing Alvin
and should hurry over as fast as her feet could carry
her. Susannah liked to hear Sarah Ann tell of the
strange events of which she read, of the man whose
head was turning into the head of a lion, of the dog
who had learned to talk, of the woman who put
glass into her husband&#39;s pies. But Susannah loved
better to hear Sarah Ann tell of Alvin.</p>

<p class="indent">Now Susannah stood with arms akimbo, with
shakes of head, with astonished clapping of lips
together.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This makes the understanding stand still,&quot;
declared Susannah as she listened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He gave her a ring already,&quot; went on Sarah Ann.
&quot;He has a wedding present ready for her. He let
himself be enlarged from a photograph and he has
a big picture. He carries a cane in the picture. He
has it hung up already in his house. He said I should
come over once and he would show it to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In Alvin&#39;s course at the normal school he had
studied not only pedagogy and psychology, but he
had had practical experience in teaching. Connected
with the normal school was a model school. There,
in a light and airy room whose windows were filled
with blooming plants and whose walls were decked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
with pictures, Alvin had given the &quot;May lesson,&quot; a
half-hour of instruction in the blossoms and birds of
spring. Vases of snowballs and iris and dishes of
bluets and violets served as illustrations for his
remarks; he had also pictures of flickers and robins.
His class was orderly and polite. For a month he
had prepared for this half-hour of teaching; he had
even reviewed with the superintendent of the model
school what he meant to say and had received her
advice and approval. Alvin thought so much about
himself and so little about any other subject that
he had by this time forgotten the ways of the
Millerstown school. The Millerstown school and
the model school were not much alike.</p>

<p class="indent">He received after his lesson was over a commendatory
letter from the superintendent, the same letter
which he had proudly exhibited to Edwin Gaumer
and the other directors. The superintendent said
that he was a young man of good presence, that he
had thoroughly mastered his subject, that he had
held the interest of his pupils throughout his teaching
period, and had maintained perfect discipline.
The superintendent did not say that she herself was
a stern person, whom no child would disobey, and
that she had remained in the room while the lesson
was in progress. The model school superintendent
could, to be sure, have conducted the lesson no
differently. It would hardly have been wise to train
the model school children to test the disciplinary
powers of their teachers by insubordination, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
order that the teachers might be trained in the various
methods for quelling riots!</p>

<p class="indent">On the 1st day of September, Alvin put on his
best suit and went to school. He had been carefully
instructed in the importance of first impressions,
the necessity for brightness and cheerfulness
of hue as well as of disposition in the schoolroom.
He had quite forgotten that the Millerstown teachers
were expected to dust and sweep the room in
which they taught.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked for his scholars along the road, but
could see none of them. He had forgotten also the
custom which awarded the best seat, which was
always the rear seat, to the first comer. In his own
day he had frequently arrived at the schoolhouse at
seven o&#39;clock of the opening day to discover that
there were half a dozen boys ahead of him.</p>

<p class="indent">The children, trained finally by Mr. Carpenter
into some respect for the office of teacher, answered
politely the good-morning with which Alvin had
been instructed to begin the school day. They
sang with gusto the familiar,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;O the joys of childhood,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Roaming through the wild wood,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Running o&#39;er the meadows,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Happy and free,&quot;&mdash;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">a favorite for several generations, since it gave full
opportunity for the use of the human voice. Then
the children set themselves with gratifying diligence
to a study of the lessons which Alvin assigned them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
Alvin had notebooks in which were Outlines of
Work for Primary Schools, Outlines of Work for
Secondary Schools, Outlines of Work for Ungraded
Schools, and the like. Here also were plans for
Nature Work and Number Work, and various other
kinds of Works whose names at least were new in
the curriculum of the Millerstown school. The children
took kindly enough to them all; they went
quietly about their tasks. The discipline of school
was pleasant. The older girls smiled at Alvin and
blushed when he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">To Sarah Ann, Alvin imparted daily fresh plans
made by him and his Bessie for the furnishing of
their house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have changed to mahogany for the dining-room.
Oak is not fashionable any more. People are
getting rid of their oak.&quot; In these statements
Alvin quoted from the clerk in a furniture store who
had showed to him and Bessie a new mahogany
set of dining-room furniture. &quot;We have picked out
our things already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarah Ann did not know much about the various
kinds of wood, but mahogany was a longer word
than oak, and the furniture made of that wood was
probably the finest that could be had. As a matter
of fact, Sarah Ann had in her house without knowing
it several fine pieces of mahogany. Sarah Ann
told Susannah about Alvin&#39;s plans and they spread
promptly over Millerstown.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a rich girl, for sure,&quot; said Millerstown.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
Once the young lady herself appeared to inspect
Alvin&#39;s house. Millerstown saw the two step from
the car and appraised the furs and the feathered
hat as well as they could, considering that furs
and feathers were not in general use in Millerstown
except upon the backs of the creatures who
wore them naturally. Millerstown was astonished
and Millerstown admired. Katy Gaumer, returning
from an hour spent with her Aunt Sally, her
feathers a scarlet nubia, her furs a crimson shawl,
blushed first scarlet and then crimson as she came
upon Alvin and his lady, and went on her way
choking back something in her throat. Alvin took
his Bessie directly to Sarah Ann&#39;s house, and Sarah
Ann, embarrassed and silent, accompanied them
upon their tour of inspection. Sarah Ann could not
explain exactly why she was invited.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is something about the fashion,&quot; she explained
to Susannah. &quot;The young folks are nowadays not
to be alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susannah laughed a scornful laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;These must be fine young folks nowadays, if
they cannot be trusted fifteen minutes to walk alone
through a cold house!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Upon the strength of Alvin&#39;s good position, and
of Sarah Ann&#39;s account of the riches of the young
lady&#39;s father, and of a dazzling glimpse of the young
lady herself, Billy Knerr trusted Alvin for the
second and the third and the fourth month&#39;s rent
of his house, the school board continued to pay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
Alvin in advance, and the coal dealer let him have
three tons of coal on credit. An Allentown tailor
made him a new winter suit on the same terms, and
Sarah Ann let him stay on without reminding him
of his board bill. Alvin hated to pay for commodities
which could be eaten, like potatoes, or which could
be burned up, like coal. When the coal was in the
cellar, he forgot entirely that presently there would
be a bill. Alvin was wholly happy; there were
moments when the contemplation of his good fortune
made him dizzy.</p>

<p class="indent">On Sunday evenings Alvin continued his attendance
at the Millerstown churches. He meant to
ally himself finally with one of them, the Lutheran,
probably, since the Weygandts and Gaumers and
Fackenthals were Lutheran. He still visited, however,
the church of the Improved New Mennonites
where Essie Hill blushed deeply under her plain hat
as he approached. There was a new legend upon
Essie&#39;s hat. Instead of being a worker in the vineyard,
she was now a soldier in the kingdom. David
Hartman still sat occasionally with her upon her
doorstep. Again her father spoke to her about
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can&#39;t marry anybody outside the church,
Essie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, pop.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Into the Reverend Mr. Hill&#39;s somber eyes there
came for an instant a hopeful gleam.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps we could get him in the church?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; agreed Essie. &quot;I talk to him sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was in December when Fate turned against
Alvin. Alvin had now burned his supply of coal and
was angrily refused more. Alvin&#39;s Allentown tailor,
failing to receive replies to his letter, sent a collector
to interview Alvin, an insistent person who, failing
to find him at home, visited him at the schoolhouse.
Even Sarah Ann, who was patience personified,
reminded her boarder gently that she had fed him
for four months without any return.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did it to earn a little extra missionary money,
Alvin,&quot; explained Sarah Ann. &quot;We have at this
time of the year always a Thank Offering. I thought
I would earn this to put in my box.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In December, the spirit of evil entered the
Millerstown school. The familiar sound of twanging
wires, of slamming desk lids, the soft slap of moistened
paper balls striking the blackboards, were the
first warnings of the rise of rebellion. The Millerstown
children had not enough to do. Their teacher
had reached the end of his outlines and knew not
how to make more. He was desperately tired of
teaching; he could not understand how he could ever
have supposed that Mr. Carpenter had an easy or
a pleasant time.</p>

<p class="indent">One morning when he entered the schoolroom, he
found the blackboard decorated with a caricature
of himself, labeled with the insulting appellation
which Susannah Kuhns had once bestowed upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
him, &quot;Der Fratzhans.&quot; There were only two pupils
who were skillful enough to have drawn so lifelike
a representation of their teacher; they were two of
the four large girls in the upper class, of whose
admiration Alvin had been certain. It was a cruel
blow for poor Alvin.</p>

<p class="indent">Again the collector who represented the tailor
visited him. This time he met Alvin on Main Street,
in front of the post-office, and at the top of his loud
and unfeeling voice, demanded instant payment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will get it,&quot; promised Alvin. &quot;Till Monday I
will have it for sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It must be said in justice to Alvin that he did not
think at once of making application to Katy Gaumer
for succor in his financial situation. To his Bessie he
offered no such slight as that. But succor Alvin
must have. He knew so little about the law that he
feared he might be cast into prison. When he had
got rid of the insulting creature and his demands,
he dressed himself in the suit under discussion and at
once sought Bessie at her father&#39;s house in the county
seat.</p>

<p class="indent">There, alas! Alvin did not behave in a manner
befitting one whose education and manners were so
fine. He asked Bessie plainly and frankly for a loan,
having been led by Miss Katy Gaumer to expect
an immediate and favorable response from any
female whom he honored with such a request. To
his astonishment Bessie stared at him rudely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you want money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
&quot;To pay a few things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you have any money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn&#39;t time yet for my salary.&quot; In reality
Alvin had been paid as at first, in advance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you have any money in the bank?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, no!&quot; It had never occurred to Alvin to do
anything with money but spend it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you paid for the furniture?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The furniture?&quot; repeated Alvin weakly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, the furniture.&quot; Bessie was growing redder
and redder, her voice sharper. &quot;The furniture that
you and I picked out this long while!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, no,&quot; confessed Alvin, &quot;I thought that you&mdash;that
you would&mdash;would&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You thought <i>I</i> would pay for it!&quot; Bessie&#39;s voice
rose so high that her whole family might have heard
if they had not considerately left the house to
her and her beau. &quot;Well, you were mistaken!&quot;&mdash;Bessie
was a slangy person, she said that Alvin was
&quot;stung.&quot; &quot;And here&quot;&mdash;Bessie ran upstairs and
returned with a letter&mdash;&quot;here is this. I thought, of
course, this was a mistake. I paid no attention to it.
Open it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin grew pale. He recognized, before the envelope
was in his hand, the business card on the corner.
The bill for Bessie&#39;s ring had come to him many
times. Now upon the bill Bessie laid the ring itself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There!&quot; said she.</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin remembered suddenly how David Hartman
had appeared on the mountain long ago and had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
hurled himself upon him. He had now much the
same sensations.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean that it is over?&quot; he faltered in a
dazed tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Bessie in a very firm, decided
tone; &quot;I mean just that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After Alvin had carried the ring back to the
jeweler, a way suggested itself of paying the tailor.
He returned his beautiful best winter suit, worn but
a very few times, and received some credit on his
bill. The balance, alas! remained, and the tailor
seemed but slightly mollified by his humility. The
coal bill remained also, but the coal had been burned
and could not be restored to the dealer. The landlord
had also been deprived of the rent for his house,
the food had been eaten. What Alvin should do
about the landlord and about Sarah Ann he did not
know. Alvin had a sad Christmas.</p>

<p class="indent">January and February passed slowly. Alvin was
still too proud to confess to Millerstown that Bessie
had jilted him; he paid a little on his great rent bill
as means of staving off the discovery a little longer.
The children in school became entirely ungovernable,
their invention more brilliant and demoniacal.
The stovepipe fell with a crash to the floor, the
flying soot blackening the faces of teacher and
pupils alike. Alvin found his overshoes filled with
powdered chalk and damp sponges; he met fresh
pictures of himself when he opened the door. When
he undertook in midwinter to raise a mustache there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
appeared promptly upon the upper lip of most of his
pupils a dark and suggestive line. The children
grew more impertinent, the bills more pressing. In
despair Alvin climbed the hill and ransacked the
little house where he had lived with his father. He
thought bitterly of William, who had squandered
his money on madness, and who had given his son
so unpleasant a life.</p>

<p class="indent">He found nothing in the little house. As he shut
the door behind him, he remembered how John
Hartman had sat dead in his buggy before the gate
as he and Katy came down the mountain road.</p>

<p class="indent">At once a warm glow flooded the soul of Alvin.
How comforting had been the touch of Katy on
that frightful day, how brave she had been! How
kind Katy had been to him always, how freely she
had granted all he asked! And now Katy was rich,
she had doubtless inherited a good deal of money
from her grandmother, and she was earning dear
knows what liberal salary at the rich Hartmans&#39;.
She had come to take a sensible view of education;
she had decided, Alvin was certain, that it counted
for nothing. To Katy his heart warmed. He remembered
her with tears.</p>

<p class="indent">At once Alvin hastened back to his little house,
and there, sitting straightway down at his table,
indited a letter. Composition was easy; he had long
ago written a model.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Dear, dear Katy</span>,&mdash;I am in great trouble. I
need a little money. If you have any, Katy, say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
about $25, put it in the hole in the wall. Katy, say
you will.&quot; Then Alvin added a postscript. &quot;I am
not going to marry, Katy. I have broken it all off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Alvin did not present his letter. Instead, he
held it until he should have made trial of another
expedient. Perhaps some fragment of Katy&#39;s earlier
largess still remained in the putlock hole!</p>

<p class="indent">That evening Alvin attended service at the
church of the Improved New Mennonites. He was
so unhappy that he dared not be alone, and in the
church of the Improved New Mennonites he would
meet none of his creditors, all of whom belonged to
the larger, longer established churches. Here, too,
Essie smiled at him. Essie was a comfortable person;
she was neither ambitious for learning nor
scornful of those who had no money. The preacher
exhorted his congregation to make a fresh start;
this Alvin determined to do.</p>

<p class="indent">On the way home he made a détour through the
open fields until he reached the back of the Gaumer
garden. Through the garden he crept softly. The
night was dark, the wind whistled mournfully
through the doors of the Gaumer barn. Alvin
slipped and fell when his foot sank into the burrow
of a mole. But Alvin pressed on.</p>

<p class="indent">When he put his hand into the putlock hole and
his fingers touched the hard stone, he could have
sunk to the ground with disappointment. Again he
thrust in his hand and could find nothing. A third
time he tried, pushing his cuff back on his arm so as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
to insert his hand as far as possible. A fourth time
he reached in vain. In the old days when Katy had
laid there for him the fat bills, they had always
been within easy reach. Finally, in the last gasp of
hope, he took from his pocket a long lead pencil and
felt about with its tip. The broad stone which
formed the floor of the putlock hole sloped; there,
in the little pit at the back, Alvin&#39;s pencil touched
an object which he could move about.</p>

<p class="indent">After much prying he drew it forth, a round half-dollar,
a part of the last wages which Katy had
received from Mrs. Hartman.</p>

<p class="indent">He held it in his hand and tried desperately to
reach its fellows. Surely the Fates would not mock
him with a half-dollar when his needs were so great!
To-morrow evening he would bring a bent wire and
see what he could do with that.</p>

<p class="indent">With the blessed coin in his hand, Alvin turned
his steps homeward.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br/>
BEVY PUTS A HEX ON ALVIN</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">After</span> Katy had cleaned the Hartman attic, she
cleaned one by one the Hartman bedrooms. Cupboards
and closets were emptied of their contents;
clothes, blankets, great, thick comforts were carried
to the yard and there were beaten and aired and
restored to their places. Carpets were taken up to
be put through the same process and then were
nailed down once more to the floor, with mighty
stretching of arms and pulling of fingers. Floors
were scrubbed, paint was wiped, windows were
polished; even the outside of the house was washed,
the walls being approached by a leaning down from
the upper windows, long-handled brush well in
hand, and a stretching up from the lower windows.
Any well-trained Pennsylvania German housewife is
amply able to superintend the putting in order of an
operating-room in a hospital.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hartman superintended the cleaning, though
she was able to take no part. She lay day after day
on the old settle in the kitchen and was helped night
after night to her bed. She did not like to be helped;
if she could make the journey herself while Katy
was for a moment busy elsewhere, or when Katy
had run down to sit for a few minutes with her Aunt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
Sally, she was well pleased. As the hoard in Katy&#39;s
bank grew, Katy&#39;s heart became lighter, her tongue
moved with some of its old gayety. But Cassie
made no answer; she said nothing, indeed, from
day&#39;s beginning to day&#39;s end, except to give Katy
directions about her work. Dr. Benner came occasionally
to see her, rather as one who watches the
progress of an incurable disease than as one who
hopes to stay its course. The Lutheran preacher
visited her and was received with all appropriate
ceremony. Then, according to the old German custom,
all work ceased and the family waited upon its
guest. In nothing outside her house was Cassie
interested. It seemed that for Cassie the springs of
life had at last run dry.</p>

<p class="indent">When her day&#39;s work was done, Katy went to her
room and read half the night away. David had
brought home the sets of standard works in beautiful
bindings which he had bought from agents who
visited the college; and now into the stories of Scott
and Dickens and Thackeray, stored by Cassie&#39;s command
in David&#39;s cupboard, Katy plunged as a diver
plunges into a stream. The books had not been
packed away in any order of author or subject;
upon them Katy seized as they came to hand. When
she could not understand what she read&mdash;and
there were many poems and essays at which Katy
blinked without comprehension&mdash;she cried, thinking
with bitter regret and heartache that now she
might have been in school.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
&quot;And I am a servant girl!&quot; sighed Katy. &quot;It is
no shame to be a servant girl, but it is a black shame
for me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Daily she made mental reckoning of the silver
dollars and half-dollars accumulating in the putlock
hole.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But there are the two hundred dollars!&quot; she
cried. &quot;What shall I say to them about the two
hundred dollars! Perhaps when I have paid the
squire his fifty dollars, I could tell him that the two
hundred dollars was gone and he could get uncle to
give me some of my money. Perhaps I can sing
again!&quot; The pictures of foreign places in a beautiful
book of David&#39;s made her heart throb. &quot;Once I
thought I could see all such places!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Katy hid her face in her hands and David&#39;s
beautiful book slid from her lap to the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">At Christmas time David Hartman came home.
He had attained his full height; his gray eyes looked
clearly into the eyes of those who spoke to him. He
stood at the head of his class; he had gained confidence
in himself. He had asked his mother for a
larger allowance and had received it promptly. It
amused him to flaunt his money in the eyes of the
college, to spend large sums as though they were
nothing. He brought his mother handsome presents,
and his mother had handsome presents for him. It
seemed as though he and she finally understood
each other. Of resting his head on any one&#39;s shoulder,
David thought no more; into his throat came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
no choking sensations as of old. At Millerstown&#39;s
pronunciations and Millerstown&#39;s customs David
laughed. When it was necessary for Katy to be with
him, she recounted to him the Millerstown news and
David listened politely. Presently it seemed to
Katy that he was laughing at her; then she said no
more. It was not necessary for them to have much
speech together; Katy went down to her Aunt
Sally&#39;s to sleep while David was at home, leaving
the Hartman house soon after supper. During
the day she did not see him except in his mother&#39;s
presence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have read some of your books,&quot; she told him
one afternoon when she sat at the window sewing
and he sat on the opposite side of the kitchen with a
book, and Cassie lay asleep on the settle between
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is right,&quot; said David. &quot;I hope you have
enjoyed them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did.&quot; Katy laid down her sewing. If she could
talk about these books with David! &quot;I read first of
all Wanity&mdash;&quot; oh, terrible slip of a tongue which
knew better! &quot;I mean Vanity Fair!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A flash came into David&#39;s eyes, a flash of bitter
reminiscence. To Katy it was a flash of amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Vanity Fair is a fine book,&quot; said David. But
David&#39;s tongue betrayed him again. David, too,
said &quot;Wanity.&quot; To Katy the tone was mocking.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy said no more. Katy went to visit her Aunt
Sally even in the afternoons.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
&quot;&#39;I am brutish as the ox and the ass,&#39;&quot; quoted
Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">When the preacher came to see David she could
not slip away, though she tried hard. She had to
listen to the two discussing David&#39;s work. She was
even unfamiliar with the names of some of his studies.</p>

<p class="indent">David, to the awe and envy of his college mates,
had for some time kept a riding-horse. He rode
while he was at home on a young horse of the
Weygandts&#39; which Jimmie had trained to the
saddle. Millerstown watched him with admiration
as he galloped along the village streets in curious
riding-clothes; the squire shook his head over him.
The squire was Cassie&#39;s adviser; he knew the extent
of the fortune which David was to inherit; he was
well acquainted also with the curious mental inheritance
which was David&#39;s. He could not get on with
David, who was as taciturn as his parents.</p>

<p class="indent">David rode about to all his mother&#39;s farms and
orchards and to the fine woodland on the mountain
with its precious soil. Many persons were dependent
upon the Hartman estate for their livelihood, more
would be dependent when the mines could be opened
again. There came into David&#39;s mind as he rode
homeward a dim vision like the vision his father had
seen of a happy community of which he should be
the head. But David did not try to make his vision
clear to himself. He was passing the poorhouse and
his thoughts turned to the Koehler family. Alvin
he hated; with Alvin he still owed the settlement of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
debt, even though Katy Gaumer seemed to think
of him no more. William Koehler himself had been
punished; he was praying and gibbering somewhere
behind the walls of the poorhouse. David thought
of his father, and the rage of his youth against the
Koehlers swelled his heart again almost to bursting.
Without exception he hated Millerstown.</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, David went once or twice to see the
little Improved New Mennonite, a proceeding which
amazed and disgusted Millerstown. Susannah Kuhns
expressed to Katy Millerstown&#39;s opinion that that
connection would &quot;give a match&quot;; then she recounted
to Katy at great length the ambitious plans
of Alvin and his bride.</p>

<p class="indent">When David returned to school, Katy went back
to her room in the Hartman house. Christmas had
been dreary with its memories and its contrasts
with the past; Katy was not sorry to have again
constant occupation for her mind and her hands.
She straightened out the slight disorder caused by
the presence of David; she got the meals as usual;
she exchanged a few words with the invalid; and
when the quiet of night had settled upon the house,
she lit the lamp in her room and opened the beautiful
illustrated book at the page upon which she had
closed it. But Katy did not proceed with the
account of the Coliseum. Katy closed the book,
and drawing her scarlet shawl a little closer about
her shoulders, laid her cheek down on the bureau.
Katy was again obsessed. She saw David&#39;s clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
gray eyes, looking at her in astonishment as she
applied for a servant&#39;s place in his mother&#39;s house.
She heard his speech, so unlike her own; he seemed
to stand close beside her. She saw again that flicker
of amusement in his eyes, heard again that unconscious
mockery. David was a part of the great world
into which she had expected to fare forth. David
was English. David was as far above her as the stars.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He wasn&#39;t in the beginning!&quot; cried Katy. &quot;I
have made myself what I am. I am mean and low
and ignorant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Katy rose from her chair and clasped her
hands across her heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I to have <i>this</i> again?&quot; cried Katy. &quot;Alvin is
only just out of my mind. What am I to do? What
<i>am</i> I to do? What am I made of? I am worse than
Mary Wolle and Sally Hersh. If I cannot have one
in my mind to worry me, then I must have another.
Am I to have no peace in this world?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy looked about the little room with its narrow
bed, its little bureau, its single chair, its cupboard
crowded with books. Katy remembered that this
was David&#39;s room, that here he slept, had slept only
last night. Katy knelt down by the bed and began
to pray, not for David, but for herself.</p>

<p class="indent">By morning Katy had made a firm resolution.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will think only of this money. I have twenty-four
dollars saved. In four months I will be free of
my debt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">January, February, and March saw poor Cassie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
growing weaker and more silent, saw Katy&#39;s hoard
swelling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is thirty dollars!&quot; said she. &quot;Now it is thirty-six
dollars!&quot; &quot;Now it is forty-two dollars!&quot; Frequently
Katy thanked God. A little lighter grew
her heart.</p>

<p class="indent">One evening in March a sudden uneasiness overwhelmed
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will go down and count it,&quot; said she. &quot;Perhaps
I should put it in a safer place. But no one knows
that the hole is there but a few people, and no one
could get a hand into the bottom but me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was not Saturday; Katy had no sum to add to
the deposit; but she wrapped her shawl about her
and went down to the Gaumer house. There,
laughing at herself for her uneasiness, she rolled
back her sleeve and thrust her arm deep into her
hiding-place. Then she stood perfectly still and
with a moan began to feel about. The little pit had
no outlet; it was still safe and dry, a capital hiding-place,
provided one kept its existence to one&#39;s self,
but it was empty.</p>

<p class="indent">At first Katy could not believe the evidence of her
senses. Frantically she thrust in her hand, reluctantly
she drew it out and felt of it with the other
hand and even laid it along her cheek. It was not
until she had repeated this process several times
that she was able to appreciate the truth. The putlock
hole was empty, her hard-earned hoard was
gone, freedom from debt cruelly postponed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
Then Katy, who had so bravely hidden her various
troubles from Millerstown and from her kin,
began to cry like a crazy person. She struck at
the hard stone wall until her hands bled; she ran,
crying and sobbing, to her Uncle Edwin&#39;s door,
and burst it open, frightening him and Aunt Sally
nearly out of their wits as they sat by the kitchen
table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My money is gone!&quot; she cried, seizing Uncle
Edwin by the arm. &quot;I tell you my money is gone!
It is stolen! It is not there! Somebody has run
away with it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your money!&quot; gasped Uncle Edwin, struggling
to his feet. &quot;What money? Where had you money,
Katy? Who stole it? In Heaven&#39;s name, Katy,
what is wrong?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy sank down on the old settle and stared at
them wildly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had money in the hole in the wall.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What hole in the wall, Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right here in this wall, where Bevy put cakes
for me when I was little and lived with my gran&#39;pop.
I had all my money that I ever earned there&mdash;it
was forty-two dollars. Cassie would tell you that
she gave me forty-two dollars already, or you could
count it up by weeks. On Saturday evening it was
there, and now it is gone. Oh, what shall I do, what
shall I do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy began to wring her hands; Aunt Sally besought
her, weeping, to lie down; Uncle Edwin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
reached to the high mantel-shelf where he had laid
his gun out of little Adam&#39;s reach.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no one there now!&quot; cried Katy. &quot;It is
no use to go now! I can reach to the bottom of the
hole and there is not a penny there.&quot; She began to
repeat what she had said. &quot;My money is gone! My
money is gone!&quot; William Koehler when he was
accused of stealing the communion service had
behaved no more crazily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will go for the squire,&quot; said Uncle Edwin,
moving toward the door, gun in hand. &quot;That is the
first thing to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Uncle Edwin paused. From without rose
a fearful uproar. There were loud cries in a man&#39;s
voice, there were shrill reproaches and commands
in a woman&#39;s. There were even squeals. Aunt Sally
added her screams to those which proceeded from
without. Uncle Edwin advanced boldly, his empty
gun lifted to his shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is Bevy!&quot; cried Aunt Sally. &quot;Some one has
Bevy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bravely Aunt Sally followed Uncle Edwin; weeping
Katy followed Aunt Sally. At the corner of the
house they paused in unspeakable amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">The squire had opened his door; from it a broad
shaft of light shot out across the lawn which separated
the two houses. It illuminated brightly the
opening of the putlock hole and its vicinity. There
an extraordinary tableau presented itself to the
eyes of Katy Gaumer and her kin. The center of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
the stage was occupied by Bevy and a struggling
man. Over his head Bevy had thrown her gingham
apron; she twisted it now tightly like a tourniquet
and screamed for help.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thief! Thief!&quot; shouted Bevy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My ear! My ear!&quot; cried a muffled voice from
beneath the apron, a voice recognized immediately
by one at least of the astonished spectators.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not care for your ear,&quot; screamed Bevy.
&quot;Your ear is nothing to me. You were stealing!
What is it that you have stolen?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Wildly Alvin tried to free himself; frantically
Bevy clung to him. Bevy now found an ally in
Uncle Edwin, who seized the prisoner in a firm grasp.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whoa, there!&quot; cried Uncle Edwin. &quot;I have him,
Bevy. I have him by the arm. You can let him
go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was the sound of approaching footsteps, of
opening doors, there were questions and outcries.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I heard some one yelling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I bring a gun?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was a pig that squealed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is wrong with everybody?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The squire came flying across the lawn. He saw
as he opened the door the struggling Alvin and the
excited Bevy and Edwin Gaumer armed here on
this peaceful night with a gun. He saw also his
grandniece with her flaming cheeks, her swollen
eyes, her disheveled hair. The squire did not know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
what had happened, but he closed his door behind
him so that the scene should be no longer illuminated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing is wrong,&quot; he declared sternly. &quot;Nobody
shall bring a gun.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a gesture he ordered his kinsfolk and Bevy
and her prey into his office; with an arm thrown
across her shoulders he protected his niece from
further observation. Then, cruelly, upon Millerstown
he shut his office door. For a while Millerstown
hung about; then having recognized no one
but the squire, and neither able to see nor to hear
further, departed for their several homes.</p>

<p class="indent">Inside the squire locked the door and motioned
his excited guests to seats. If Katy had had her
way she would have died on the spot, she would
have sunk into the earth and would have been
swallowed up. But with the squire&#39;s arm about her
she could do nothing but proceed to his office with
the rest.</p>

<p class="indent">The squire looked from one to the other, from
Edwin with his gun to Aunt Sally with her round
and staring eyes; from Bevy to Alvin, who smoothed
his hair and laid a protecting hand over his suffering
ear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What on earth is the matter with you people?&quot;
he demanded. &quot;Has war broken out in Millerstown?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At once began an indescribable clamor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was going over to Sally a little&mdash;&quot; this was
Bevy. &quot;I saw him.&quot; Bevy indicated her prisoner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
with a contemptuous gesture. &quot;He was digging in
the hole, and I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You didn&#39;t!&quot; contradicted Alvin. &quot;You didn&#39;t!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What hole?&quot; asked the squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you dare to say I didn&#39;t take you by the
ear?&quot; cried Bevy with threatening fingers lifted
toward that aching member.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The hole where Katy had her money,&quot; explained
Edwin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was stolen,&quot; cried Aunt Sally.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t!&quot; protested Alvin again, his face green
with fright. He blamed his own greediness for the
discovery. On Sunday evening he had taken all
Katy&#39;s hoard; why had he been so mad as to return
to seek more?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A mule is a mule,&quot; proclaimed Bevy Schnepp.
&quot;A Koehler is a Koehler. They steal; you cannot
better them by education; they are all the time the
same, they&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be still, Bevy!&quot; commanded the squire.</p>

<p class="indent">But Bevy would not be still. She gave another
scream and began to dance up and down in her grasshopper-like
fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look at him, once! He says he didn&#39;t, does he?
Look once what he has in his hand!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At once all eyes turned with closer scrutiny upon
Alvin. He still held in his hand the implement with
which he had coaxed Katy&#39;s dollars and half-dollars
from the depths of the putlock hole. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
only a bit of twisted wire, but it had done its work
well.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Like father, like son!&quot; screamed Bevy again.
&quot;What did I say? Where did he get the money to
get educated? Where&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bevy, be still!&quot; commanded the squire in a
sterner tone. &quot;Katy, did you keep your money in
the putlock hole?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Katy in a low voice. Here, face
to face with Alvin, she remembered all the past, her
long vigils on the porch when she watched for him,
his kiss in the shadow, his later, different kisses, his
ingratitude, her shame. Katy&#39;s head sank lower
and lower on her breast.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you select such a place for a bank,
Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I used to keep things there when I was a little
girl. Into the deep part nobody could put a hand
but me. That is why I thought it was safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The squire looked more and more angry. His
voice sank deeper and deeper in his throat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You didn&#39;t count on bent wire, did you? How
much money did you have there, Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy answered so faintly that the squire could
not hear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She said forty-two dollars,&quot; answered Uncle
Edwin for her. Uncle Edwin had now stationed
himself behind Alvin; at Alvin&#39;s slightest motion
he put forth a hand to seize him. The Gaumers had
not been able to defend their kinswoman from her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
own incomprehensible foolishness, but from such
bold assault from without they were amply able to
protect her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is this so, Katy?&quot; asked the squire.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy&#39;s head sank on her breast. &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Alvin, look at me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin lifted his head slowly. He saw jail yawning
before him. If they searched his house, they could
still find a few of Katy&#39;s silver coins. Then under
the pressure of fear&mdash;Alvin as yet felt no shame&mdash;his
mind worked to some purpose. There was one
possible defense to make; this he offered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy often gave me money and put it in that
place for me,&quot; he said, boldly. &quot;There I got it many
times. Ain&#39;t&mdash;&quot; Alvin&#39;s normal school training
suddenly forsook him&mdash;&quot;ain&#39;t it so, Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must be wandering in your mind, Alvin,&quot;
said the squire, scornfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There he will not wander far,&quot; cried Bevy with
a shrill laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin rose from his chair and approached Katy.
Color returned to his cheek, his eyes brightened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ain&#39;t it so, Katy, that you often put money in
that hole for me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humbug!&quot; cried the squire.</p>

<p class="indent">But Alvin persisted. He went nearer to Katy,
and with single united motion Katy&#39;s relatives
sprang toward him. Aunt Sally put her arm round
her niece, Bevy made a threatening motion toward
Alvin&#39;s ear, Uncle Edwin seized him by the arm.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
But Alvin grew ever bolder. Despite the threats of
Bevy and the hand of Edwin, he took another step
toward Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say you gave money to me often, Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy answered in a low voice. She was too confused
to think of any expedient; she answered with
the truth. Perhaps that would put an end to this
intolerable scene. It would be bad enough to have
them know, but it was worse to stand here in misery
with them all staring at her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered Alvin, &quot;I did give you sometimes
money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What!&quot; cried the squire.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Edwin and Bevy each gave a kind of
groan.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy lifted her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I said &#39;yes.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now Bevy began to cry aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Next time I will not take you to the squire, you
lump! Next time I will twist your ear quite off. I
will settle you right!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bevy, you had better go,&quot; suggested the squire;
and meekly Bevy departed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Edwin, suppose you and Sally leave these young
people here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Together Uncle Edwin and Aunt Sally approached
the door. Aunt Sally was wiping her eyes on her
apron; Uncle Edwin walked with bent head as
though the name of Gaumer was disgraced forever.
Them the squire followed to the door, and outside,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
wishing to be certain that no curious Millerstonians
lingered. With his hand on the outer knob, he
closed the door while he promised to see Edwin
later in the evening. Edwin stopped to express his
horror at this strange situation; their conversation
consumed a few seconds at least.</p>

<p class="indent">Behind the closed door Alvin approached Katy
as she stood by the squire&#39;s desk, numb, smitten,
unable to raise her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy,&quot; said he, softly, &quot;I do not care if you have
worked out, Katy. That is less than nothing to me.
I am never going to marry that other one. She is no
good. I will marry you, Katy. I did not know&quot;&mdash;Alvin&#39;s
voice shook&mdash;&quot;I did not know till this time
how I love you, Katy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this point Alvin laid his hand upon Katy&#39;s
arm and applied a tender pressure.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, suddenly, furiously, Alvin was flung aside,
back against the sharp point of the squire&#39;s desk.
Young women do not keep house in the Pennsylvania
German fashion, with sweeping and scrubbing
and beating of carpets, without developing
considerable muscular power. Terrified, bruised by
contact with the sharp corner of the desk, Alvin
lifted hands to defend himself from Katy, whose
worth he had learned so suddenly to value.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy, however, stayed to punish him no further.
Instead, she rushed across the room and threw herself
into the arms of the squire. She spoke shrilly,
she sobbed and cried.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
&quot;Send him away and let me talk to you alone!
I must talk to you! Oh, please send him away!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin needed no orders. He read in the squire&#39;s
expression permission to depart, and he slipped
sidewise out the door, making himself as small as
possible for the passage.</p>

<p class="indent">When the door had closed behind him, the squire
put Katy into a corner of the sofa in his back office
and sat down beside her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Katy, begin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With tears and hysterical laughter, Katy began
her story.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought I was so fine and powerful when I
helped him. I thought I was rich with my two hundred
dollars and that I could do anything. I thought
he had no chance and I would help him. I pitied
him because he had a bad name from his father.
The worst thing was I liked him. Oh, dear! Oh,
dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The squire&#39;s frown grew blacker and blacker.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He took the money and never paid any of it
back, and then stole this from you yet! Money you
were saving to pay me! Money you had borrowed
for him! Oh, Katy, Katy!&quot; Then, suddenly, the
squire laughed. &quot;Katy, dear, I bought a gold brick
like this once. It wasn&#39;t just like this, but it cost
me much more. We&#39;ve got to learn, all of us! Oh,
you poor soul! And my gold brick was not bought
for the sake of charity, Katy!&quot; The squire laughed
and laughed and Katy cried and cried as her head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
rested upon the broad shoulder which had been
offered to her earlier. &quot;Now, Katy, it is late and I
will take you home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The squire put Katy&#39;s scarlet shawl about her and
took her by the arm, and together they went up the
misty street. At the Hartmans&#39; gate the squire left
his companion. Then, with a quicker stride he
sought the house of Alvin Koehler.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br/>
ALVIN DOES PENANCE AND IS SHRIVEN</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> squire stayed for fifteen minutes with Alvin
Koehler; when he left, Alvin was limp; he sat in his
little house and wept. Hitherto in his life Alvin
had had grave difficulties; he had been unhappy in
his poverty; he had been embarrassed by the queerness
of his father; he had been disturbed when he
feared that Katy Gaumer would not keep her
promise and help him go to school; he had been
terrified by the behavior of the Millerstown children
and by the overshadowing cloud of his unpaid bills.</p>

<p class="indent">But now a new emotion filled his heart and
weighed down his spirit. He was now, for the first
time, bitterly ashamed. He had told the squire all
his misery; his debt to the storekeeper, to the landlord,
to Sarah Ann, to Katy, to the coal dealer, to
the jeweler, to the tailor. He had a notion that in
thus confessing he was doing penance. He had also
a vain and foolish hope that the squire might offer
to help him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am turned inside out,&quot; he mourned when the
squire had gone. &quot;There is nothing to me any
more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was on Friday that Alvin was caught, wire in
hand, investigating the contents of Katy&#39;s putlock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
bank. That night he did not sleep. He sat by his
table, pencil in hand, contemplating the problem
which confronted him and trying to work out a sum
in proportion. If he owed Katy two hundred and
fifty dollars, and Sarah Ann Mohr twenty dollars,
and the landlord fifty-eight dollars, and the coal
dealer fifteen dollars, and the tailor thirty dollars,
how much of his next month&#39;s salary should justly
go to each&mdash;provided, of course, that he were not
summarily dismissed from his position and thus deprived
of his salary? Over the difficult problem he
fell asleep toward morning.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not go to Sarah Ann&#39;s for breakfast, a fact
which caused Sarah Ann no uneasiness, as he usually
took advantage of the Saturday holiday to sleep late
and thus make a good recovery from the exhaustion
following his arduous association with the Millerstown
children. Besides, another subject had this
morning the whole of Sarah Ann&#39;s attention and the
attention of Millerstown. Cassie Hartman had died
suddenly in the night.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor did Alvin go to Sarah Ann&#39;s for dinner, but
supported life with some crackers and apples which
were in his house. It seemed to him that the passers-by
looked curiously at his dwelling; he was certain
that the story of his difficulties had spread over
Millerstown. Who could ever have dreamed that
Katy would treat him so shabbily?</p>

<p class="indent">Late in the afternoon there came a ponderous
step along his board walk and a knock at the door.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
Terrified, Alvin sat still until the rap was repeated,
then he opened the door a tiny crack. Without
stood a no more terrifying person than Sarah Ann.</p>

<p class="indent">At sight of Sarah Ann, however, Alvin trembled.
Sarah Ann had again reminded him, gently but with
firmness, that her Thank Offering was long overdue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I made it up out of the money I keep for regular
collections, Alvin,&quot; Sarah Ann had explained.
&quot;I keep that money in a little can. But now that
little can is empty. I have nothing for General
Fund.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot pay you.&quot; Thus Alvin greeted her
miserably through an inch-wide crack. &quot;I will try
to pay you sometime, Sarah Ann, but I cannot pay
you now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not here for pay,&quot; protested Sarah Ann,
weeping. &quot;It is not a day for collecting money in
Millerstown. Poor Cassie is gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cassie?&quot; repeated Alvin, vacantly. So engrossed
was Alvin with his own joys in time of joy, and with
his own sorrows in time of sorrow, that persons not
immediately associated with him disappeared entirely
from the circle of his consciousness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, yes, Cassie Hartman, David&#39;s mom.
David is now an orphan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin shook his head solemnly at this intelligence,
remembering that he was practically an orphan,
too. Beyond that he did not consider the situation.
He felt no satisfaction at the Hartmans&#39; misfortunes;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
he had never cherished any animosity toward
them, but only a vague envy of their worldly possessions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am here now to see why you do not come to
your dinner,&quot; went on Sarah Ann. &quot;The folks say
you are not going to get married, after all, Alvin.
Is it so, Alvin? I thought you were sick. I had
Sauerkraut for dinner, but still you did not come.
I can heat it for supper. Ach, there is nothing but
trouble in this world!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin desired to tell Sarah Ann all his woes. Like
the Ancient Mariner, he would find relief in recounting
the story of his griefs. But he was now too
weak to do anything but select a hat from the row
hanging behind the door. So low was he in his mind
that he chose the shabbiest one of all. Then he
followed Sarah Ann down the street. It seemed to
him that there were many inches between the front
of his body and his vest. He was certain that he
had lost many pounds, and he thought that perhaps
he would waste away. That, he decided gloomily,
would be one solution of his troubles.</p>

<p class="indent">Once fed, Alvin felt his spirits rise. There was
that in Sarah Ann&#39;s substantial victuals which was
calculated to put heart into a man, there was tonic
in her urging, tearful though it was.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ach, a little pie, Alvin, if it is you good enough!
It is not to-day&#39;s pie, but yesterday&#39;s pie, but it is
not yet soft. Some pies get softer than others
quicker. Ach, a little rusk, too, Alvin! It stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
round long enough already. Take jelly for on it,
Alvin. Rusk is not good without a spread. It is too
dry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When Alvin had finished the first course, he no
longer felt physically shrunken; when he had finished
the second, he had ceased entirely to be conscious
of the deadly twist of Bevy&#39;s grasp upon his
ear. Of Katy and the squire no amount of food
could hearten him to think.</p>

<p class="indent">But when he had finished his supper and had
thanked Sarah Ann and had shut himself out of her
pleasant kitchen into a cold damp night, he remembered
that he had no place to go. On other Saturdays
he had sought the home of Bessie in the
county seat, but he could not go there now.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have no father and no mother and no friends,&quot;
mourned Alvin to himself. &quot;I am an outcast. I
must go back to my cold house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The wind made the limbs of the trees creak above
his head; loose bricks sank sloppily under his feet,
splashing his ankles; his heart sank lower and
lower. The street lamps burned dimly; as most of
the citizens of Millerstown sat in the kitchens, the
fronts of their houses were dark and inhospitable.
For his own lamp at home he had no oil and no
money to buy oil. But home he must go. He saw
ahead of him two men, one tall and young, the other
broader of shoulder, and not so tall. He recognized
them as the squire and David Hartman; he realized
dully that David had just come home to his empty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
house, but his thought accompanied the two men
no farther than the next street lamp.</p>

<p class="indent">There, mental as well as physical light flashed
into Alvin&#39;s gloom. The Improved New Mennonites
were in the midst of a series of meetings; into
the misty darkness of the street their light shone
pleasantly, into the lonely quiet their song poured
cheerfully. Here was an invitation.</p>

<p class="indent">At once Alvin turned his steps toward their little
church. He remembered with a thrill, a weak thrill
it is true, but none the less a thrill, Essie&#39;s pretty
face, her curly hair, her friendly glance. To a church
every one was welcome. He went in and sat down
humbly in the last pew,&mdash;no high seat for Alvin
in his present state of mind! He saw in the front
row no little, round head of Bevy Schnepp with its
tight knot of hair at the back. Involuntarily and
with great relief Alvin lifted a hand to his own head.</p>

<p class="indent">The preacher either directed his sermon toward
Alvin, or else happened accidentally upon a text
applicable to that young gentleman&#39;s condition. He
reproved those whose hearts were set on worldly
possessions, and Alvin groaned within himself.
Doorknobs were a sign of pride&mdash;Alvin had himself
set a glittering knob upon the jamb of his front
door. Organs in the parlor were a snare&mdash;Alvin
had long since discussed the purchase of a piano
with a piano dealer. Fine clothes spelled perdition.</p>

<p class="indent">Poor Alvin began to wish himself out upon the
dark street. If what the preacher said were true,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
then he was lost. It is hard to say what Alvin&#39;s
views of the preacher&#39;s discourse would have been
if he could have continued to call his own his dear
belongings. Now that they were to be taken from
him, he felt that it was wrong ever to have had
them.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, in the depths to which he sank, Alvin
longed again more desperately than ever to make
confession and to be absolved. He could not endure
another listener so hard-hearted as the squire;
he craved a sympathetic ear, a tender eye,&mdash;a feminine
eye and ear, in short.</p>

<p class="indent">The sermon ended, pretty Essie went to the
organ. Facing the audience she looked at each one,
sighing a little at the dullness of life. Then Essie&#39;s
lovely eyes brightened. Alvin Koehler was here!
Alvin&#39;s gaze was upon her; Alvin, in spite of the
unusual disarray of his clothes, was still handsome;
his eyes responded to her glance before she looked
down at her music. During the course of the hymn
Essie looked at him again; gradually her eyes narrowed;
into them came a startled expression. She
could see the change in his appearance; his jauntiness
was gone; he was no longer the accepted lover.
Into Essie&#39;s eyes came an intent expression like that
which brightens the eyes of a hunter as he sees the
approach of his game. Alvin was not himself; he
was in trouble. Unconsciously Essie quickened the
time of her hymn so that it changed from a dirge,
intended to soften the hearts of the impenitent, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
a gay, triumphant measure. Fortunately, the hymn
was already near its end; there was no chance for
the preacher to observe the quickening of the
tune.</p>

<p class="indent">Waiting outside the door, Alvin joined Essie as
she came from the church. Her father lingered
within to talk to some of his members; there was
opportunity for long and earnest discourse as Alvin
walked by the side of Essie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see how it was,&quot; said Alvin from time to
time. Or, &quot;That was why I did it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She made me get everything ready,&quot; complained
Alvin, bitterly. &quot;Then, when I had gone to all this
expense and was in debt to it yet, she wouldn&#39;t
have me, and I had used my salary ahead, and I&mdash;I
took a little money to help myself out. It was
money I might have had if I had asked. But I didn&#39;t
like to ask. It was in a way, you might say,
mine. But I meant to put it back, Essie!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Wisely Alvin entered into no further particulars,
nor did he tell the name of the person from whom
he had taken the money. Somehow Essie got the
impression that it was the squire. That impression
Essie was allowed to keep.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you have sin on your mind.&quot; Thus with
glowing cheeks Essie diagnosed Alvin&#39;s case. In
reality Alvin had no sin, but the fear of punishment
on his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Essie&#39;s cheeks glowed more brightly; she clasped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
her hands. She was not only curing the invalid, she
was binding him to his physician forever.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must make everything right,&quot; she declared.
&quot;Everything down to the last penny. Then you
will have peace, Alvin, and not before. You must
go back to your childhood. Can you remember
anything else you did?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I took cherries from trees already,&quot; confessed
Alvin. &quot;I put once five cents in the church collection
and took six cents change out. I took often the
cakes that Bevy Schnepp baked and put in a hole
for&mdash;for&quot;&mdash;here Alvin had the grace to gulp
mightily&mdash;&quot;for other children. Ach, Essie!&quot; Alvin
was terrified by the stern gaze bent upon him. He
had expected to take her hand, to lay his head on
her shoulder, to touch her soft cheek. It was a long
time, or it seemed a long time, since Alvin had
touched a soft cheek. But instead of soothing him,
Essie grew each moment colder and more distant.
&quot;Don&#39;t turn away from me! I will do everything
you say. What shall I do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must make all these things right,&quot; commanded
the young judge. &quot;That is the only way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dare I, then, come to see you, Essie? You will
not turn me off?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must make it right with all these people,&quot;
insisted Essie again. She had taken Alvin into the
little sitting-room of her father&#39;s house. She rose
now and moved to the back of her chair as though
to put a barrier between herself and Alvin.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
Alvin went home and sat him down at his table.
The March wind had begun to blow again; Alvin&#39;s
fire was pitifully small; he anticipated the dreary
Sunday with horror.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my soul!&quot; wailed poor Alvin. &quot;Oh, my
soul!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Once more he set himself to work with paper and
pencil. There was Sarah Ann&mdash;he had often picked
raspberries as he passed along her fence, but Sarah
Ann would willingly forgive him. It would be ridiculous
even to ask Sarah Ann. Mom Fackenthal
would forgive him also for the cherries he had taken.
There was Bevy&mdash;to banish this gnawing misery
from his heart he could approach even Bevy.</p>

<p class="indent">When he had determined upon a course of action,
he went to bed and slept soundly. The course of
action, it must be confessed, would seem very
strange to a person of common sense. But Alvin
did not have common sense.</p>

<p class="indent">In the morning he slept late; in the evening he
went to the church of the Improved New Mennonites.
He would walk home with Essie, he would
talk over his plans with her. Even a medical clinic
involving the shedding of blood would not have
been altogether unpleasant to Alvin if he could have
been the subject.</p>

<p class="indent">But Essie would scarcely speak to him. She wore
under her chin a blue bow, about as much of a decoration
as her principles would allow, and she was
an alluring spectacle. When Alvin stepped to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
side, she asked him a single question, her eyes narrowing
again like a fisherman&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you made everything right?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This was Sunday!&quot; Alvin reminded her.</p>

<p class="indent">Essie made no friendly motion, but shook her
head solemnly and went on alone.</p>

<p class="indent">In the morning before school Alvin visited Mom
Fackenthal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cherries!&quot; said that pleasant old lady. &quot;It is
not time yet for cherries. You want to pay for cherries?&quot;
Mom Fackenthal was slightly deaf. &quot;You
don&#39;t owe me anything for cherries. Cherries that
you <i>stole</i>? When did you steal cherries? When you
were little! Humbug! Not a cent, Alvin. Keep
your money. Why, all boys take cherries, that is
why there are so many. Are you <i>crazy</i>, Alvin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With Sarah Ann the result of his interview was
the same.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You took my raspberries, you say? Why, I
planted those raspberries near the fence for the
children. You were welcome to them, Alvin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the way of peace was not always so easy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What!&quot; roared Bevy, furious because he dared
to approach her. &quot;You stole cakes off of me! I bet
you did, Alvin. You want to pay me? Nothing of
the kind. You pay Katy what you owe her. Get
out of here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Threatened with the broom, Alvin stood his
ground bravely. As a matter of fact, Bevy had been
strictly charged by the squire to let no word of what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
had happened escape her. But there was no reason
why she should not give Alvin a piece of her mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are good-for-nothing, Alvin. I should think
you would be ashamed of yourself. I should think
you would go and hide!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then upon the angry fire of Bevy&#39;s rage, Alvin
undertook to pour the water of a pleasant announcement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to join your church, Bevy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense!&quot; shrieked Bevy. &quot;Humbug! They
wouldn&#39;t have you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin grew maudlin in his humility.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish you would like me a little, Bevy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The farther away you are the better I like you,&quot;
shrieked Bevy like a fury.</p>

<p class="indent">The news of Alvin&#39;s strange seeking for forgiveness
followed close upon the rumor that the lady of
his choice had rejected him. Millerstown looked at
him with interest and pity. Even the landlord and
the coal dealer felt a slight softening of the heart.
The children in school were obedient for the first
time in months.</p>

<p class="indent">But there still remained several persons for Alvin
to see. He had as yet not approached the coal
dealer and the landlord. Nor had he yet interviewed
his chief debtor. Her Alvin did not dare to visit.
Nor did he wish to approach the landlord and the
coal dealer until he had a little money. But until
things were made right, Essie would have none of
him. Monday evening Alvin devoted to thought.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
On Tuesday evening he paid a mysterious visit to
the editor of the Millerstown &quot;Star.&quot; On Wednesday
evening he attended the prayer-meeting of the
Improved New Mennonites. He was a little late
because he had stopped at the post-office. From his
pocket protruded a newspaper.</p>

<p class="indent">Without asking permission, he joined Essie on
the homeward way; without invitation he followed
her into the house. He drew the paper from his
pocket and offered it to Essie. No one but an Improved
New Mennonite or an acolyte of the Improved
New Mennonites could have manufactured
so remarkable a document.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot; said Essie as she took the paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There,&quot; answered Alvin, pointing.</p>

<p class="indent">Essie&#39;s eyes followed his finger down the first
column of the first page. Sarah Ann Mohr would
find this week more food for thought and discussion
in the Millerstown local news than in the account of
men turning into lions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I have done injury to any one,&quot; read Essie,
&quot;I ask that they forgive me. <span class="smcap">Alvin Koehler.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Essie&#39;s eyes did not lift from the page for a long
time. When they did, they had ceased to burn.
Since her first advent into Millerstown, Essie had
longed for a possession which she considered precious.
Now, at last, it was hers. Now, at last, also
was there hope for Alvin.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br/>
A SILVER CHALICE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">With</span> knees trembling and lips quivering, Katy
hastened across the Hartman lawn. She was still
smarting too hotly from the shock of her loss and
the shame of discovery to realize how great a burden
had been lifted from her shoulders by the mere
sharing of her secret. Poor Alvin seemed meaner
than he was, her association with him criminal, herself
imbecilic. She remembered his touch with
loathing, his beseeching gaze with disgust. She
thought of his father, with his queer, glancing eyes,
his muttering, his praying. It was no wonder that
David Hartman despised them. She saw herself
through David&#39;s scornful eyes; she remembered the
outrageous struggle at the Sheep Stable; she could
have sunk through the ground in her distress.</p>

<p class="indent">But David had been avenged. Against her new
madness of affection Katy was still struggling. By
night she dreamed of David, by day she thought of
David. Her care of Cassie, her sweeping and cleaning
of the great house, had become labors of love.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not think even any more of education,&quot;
mourned Katy in her alarm. &quot;I am at last quite
crazy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She hurried now into the Hartman kitchen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
alarmed because she had been so long away. Cassie
grew daily worse, a little less able to make the
journey from her bed to the settle in the kitchen,
a little more preoccupied, a little more silent.
Katy&#39;s attentions troubled her, she did not like to
have a hand laid upon her shoulder or an arm thrown
round her. Once, when she had insisted upon going
about the house, she had fainted, and Katy had
sent in terror for the doctor, and Cassie had been
put to bed in her little room. When she had recovered
in a measure, she told Katy where she would
find in the drawers of one of the great bureaus certain
clothes for her laying away. It was not a cheerful
position which Katy held!</p>

<p class="indent">To-day Cassie had stayed in her bed, her cheek
on her hand, her eyes closed. Often she lay thus for
hours. She did not seem to think, often she did not
seem to breathe. The atrophy of Cassie&#39;s mind and
heart were almost complete.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy, opening the door softly, so as not to rouse
Cassie if she slept, found the kitchen as she had left
it, dark and silent and warm. She did not stop to
take off the scarlet shawl which she had worn when
she went to satisfy herself that her hoard was still
in the putlock hole, but climbed at once the steep,
narrow stairway which led to the rooms above. Her
body ached for rest, but there was still bread to be
set and the fire to be fixed for the night. There
awaited Katy, also, a more difficult experience than
these.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
Upstairs, also, all was dark and quiet. Katy tiptoed
across the hall to look in upon the invalid.
With hands resting on the sides of the door, she
peered in. She could see the outlines of the bureau
and the narrow bed; she thought that she heard the
even, regular breathing of the sleeper, and she was
about to turn and go down the steps. Then a startling
suspicion halted her. The bedcovers seemed to
hang straight and even to the floor, the pillows to
stand stiffly against the headboard; there was, after
all, it seemed suddenly to Katy, no sound of breathing.
For an instant she clung to the door frame,
her back to the room, then she turned slowly and
compelled herself to take the few short steps to the
bed. There she felt about with her hands. The
covers were smooth; instead of the hand or cheek
of Cassie Hartman, she touched the starched ruffles
of a fresh pillowcase.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cassie!&quot; cried Katy in wild alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no answer. Striving to make her voice
sound louder, but only succeeding in uttering a
fainter whisper, Katy cried again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cassie! Where are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still there was no answer.</p>

<p class="indent">Frantically Katy fumbled about for a match. The
room was in order, a smooth towel covered the
bureau, the bed was freshly made as though for a
stranger. Katy stared stupidly about her until the
match burned her fingers and she was left in the
darkness which seemed to close in upon her and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
smother her. The great house with its tremendous
length and breadth, its many rooms, their blackness,
the dark closets in the eaves into which one could
accidentally shut one&#39;s self and die&mdash;the great house
took shape about her, dim, mysterious, terrible.
Strange forms seemed to be here in the room crowding
upon her. Though she was aware that it threatened
her, and though she tried desperately not to
yield it entrance to her consciousness, the horrible
recollection of John Hartman&#39;s face as he sat in his
buggy on the mountain road, of the still whiteness
of the faces of her own dead, crept slowly upon her.
Must she go through this house searching for her
mistress? She dared not go for aid, when Cassie
might be lying in some corner helpless or dying.
Cassie could scarcely get out of her bed alone.
Where had she gone? Who had made up this bed?</p>

<p class="indent">Then, in time to save her reason, Katy heard a
faint voice addressing her from a distant corner of
the great house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy moved slowly along the dark hall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ach, where are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here,&quot; answered the faint voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Supporting herself against the wall, Katy crept
along. At the end a door opened into the house
proper, that seldom visited temple to the gods of
order and cleanliness. The door now stood open.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you sick?&quot; gasped Katy. &quot;Where are you?
Did you fall?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
&quot;No,&quot; came the slow answer. &quot;I am here. You
can make a light.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Falteringly Katy obeyed. On a bracket at the end
of the hall hung a lamp; this she lighted with a great
clattering of globe against chimney. Then, lifting
the lamp, she carried it into the room from which
the voice proceeded. Her scarlet shawl was still
about her, her hair was disorderly from the squire&#39;s
embrace, her eyes were wild and startled. She was
a strange contrast to the room in which she stood.</p>

<p class="indent">Here was the great high bed with its carved posts,
each terminating in a pineapple; here the interesting
steps on which one mounted to the broad plateau of
repose; here the fine curtains and the rich carpet,&mdash;all
as Katy had left them after the last careful
sweeping and dusting and polishing. But the bed
had been disturbed; in it lay the mistress of the
house, white and sick, but full of satisfaction over
having accomplished her pitiful purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy&#39;s wild eyes questioned her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was time for me to come,&quot; announced Cassie,
solemnly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was time for you to come!&quot; repeated Katy.
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My time has come,&quot; explained Cassie. &quot;You are
to go for the preacher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy clasped her hands across her breast. She
remembered now the bureau in which the white
underclothes and the black dress were kept. She
began to cry.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
&quot;Oh, no! I will go for the doctor! You shouldn&#39;t
have done this! You have made yourself worse!
I will get you the medicine the doctor gave you,
then I will run for him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will go for the preacher,&quot; directed Cassie,
wearily. &quot;My time has come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy looked wildly about her, but found no help
either in the thick carpet or the heavy hangings.
She was afraid to go, yet she did not dare to stay.
Cassie sank a little deeper into her pillows, the shadows
under her eyes seemed to darken, the covers
moved with her throbbing heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go!&quot; she commanded thickly.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy ran down the steps through the kitchen and
out to the gate. The preacher lived nearer than the
doctor; a single knock and his window was lifted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cassie Hartman must see you!&quot; cried Katy.
&quot;She is very low. Bring the doctor and come
quickly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Without staying to hear whether there were any
questions to be answered, Katy flew back into the
dark kitchen and up the narrow stairs. Cassie lay
with her eyes closed, her hands folded across her
breast.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The front door should be opened, and there
should be a light,&quot; she gasped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot leave you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go!&quot; said Cassie.</p>

<p class="indent">Again Katy flew to obey. David should be sent
for; must she remind them that David should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
sent for? It seemed to Katy that any observer could
see her obsession in her face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know where my things are, Katy,&quot; whispered
Cassie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know! But you are not going to die!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My time has come,&quot; said Mrs. Hartman.
&quot;Everything is attended to and written out in the
desk. You can tell the squire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will,&quot; faltered Katy, standing between the tall
pillars at the foot of the bed. She remembered the
squire&#39;s face as he came to tell her grandmother
that Grandfather Gaumer was dead; she thought of
David and David&#39;s face when he should be told.
David would be alone in the world; surely, though
he had all its riches, he would care! Surely his
mother had a message for him. The preacher was a
newcomer; he did not know David; he should give
him no message from his mother! And Dr. Benner
should give him no message from his mother. Katy
clasped her hands a little more closely and looked
down upon Cassie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And David?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cassie&#39;s eyelids quivered, but she made no reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some one must send for David!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When Cassie still made no answer, Katy came
round the corner of the bed and stood by the
pillow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Suppose&quot;&mdash;Katy stammered and faltered&mdash;&quot;suppose&mdash;shall
anything be said to David if&mdash;if&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
&quot;David will find everything ready,&quot; said Cassie,
wearily. &quot;He will find everything in order.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy leaned over the pillow. Cassie could not
know what it was to die, to go away forever; Cassie
could not know how one wept and mourned when
those whom one loved had died; could not know
how one remembered every word, cherished every
caress. David had no one else, and David was
young; David could not be so hard of heart as he
seemed or Cassie so stony. There was hardly a
person in Millerstown who would have ventured to
oppose Cassie, or to persuade her against her will.
But all the characteristics of Katy&#39;s youth had not
vanished; still, seeing a goal, she moved toward it,
disregarding obstacles. It seemed to her that she
heard the gate swing open and shut, heard the
sound of voices, of rapid footsteps. The preacher
and the doctor were coming, and probably other
Millerstonians would come with them. She took
Cassie by the hand and was terrified by its chill.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you not leave your love for David?&quot; she
asked, crying.</p>

<p class="indent">Cassie looked up at her with no other expression
than slight astonishment, as though Katy&#39;s language
were strange. Cassie loved nothing that could turn
and rend her. John had turned and had rent her,
but in David&#39;s case she had had a care for herself,
from misery there she had sternly and bravely
defended herself. This bright-eyed Katy with her
light step and her pretty ways had disturbed her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
had set her to dreaming at night of a house filled
with children, of growing boys and girls who would
have loved their mother and cherished her.</p>

<p class="indent">And here this same Katy hung above her, clung
to her, would not, thought poor Cassie, would not
let her die as she had planned! She did not know
that hardness of heart was in her a more terrible
hurt than any offense which love could have brought.
In her weakness she felt a sudden quiver of life in
that heart of stone; it seemed as though it melted to
water.</p>

<p class="indent">But she would not yield. She tried to draw her
hand away from the grasp which held it; she closed
her eyes; she remembered how she had defended
herself against grief. But she could not get her weak
hand away, could not shut out the sound of Katy&#39;s
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What shall I tell David? Let me tell David
something from his mother. Why, David loves you!
David will grieve for you! Oh, please!&quot; She lifted
Mrs. Hartman&#39;s white hand and held it against her
cheek, as though she would compel a blessing. &quot;Oh,
please let me tell David something!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But no word was spoken, no tears stole out from
under the closed lids. The lids quivered, opened
and closed; beyond that slight motion there was
nothing. Already the preacher and the doctor were
ascending the steps. To both the serious condition
of the invalid was evident. The doctor told Katy
in his dictatorial way that she should not have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
allowed Mrs. Hartman to leave her bed. The doctor
always spoke to Katy with irritation, as though he
could not quite escape the recollection of promises
made and forgotten.</p>

<p class="indent">Cassie lay quietly with her hands clasped once
more on her breast. Her eyes were open now; she
spoke clearly in a weak voice, the self-control, fostered
through years, serving her still. She signified
that she wished her pastor to give her the communion,
for which purpose he had brought with him
his silver flask and chalice and paten. These he
spread out on the little table at the head of Cassie&#39;s
bed.</p>

<p class="indent">On the other side of the bed stood Katy, with
wide, tearful eyes and white cheeks. The scene was
almost too solemn for endurance; the great catafalque
of a bed with its white valances and draperies,
the dark shadows in the corners of the room, the
deep silence of the night, the brightly illuminated,
earnest faces of the doctor and the preacher. But
all seemed to make Katy&#39;s eyes more clear to see,
her heart more keen to remember. Her thoughts
went back over all the solemn services she had
witnessed, the watch-night services of her childhood,
the communion services, the hour of her grandmother&#39;s
passing. She remembered the clear nights
when she had run through the snow with Whiskey
and had been at once so unhappy and so happy.
How foolish to be unhappy then when she had
everything! She remembered even that morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
long, long ago, when John Hartman had frightened
her. Surely, as her grandmother said, she must have
imagined that rage! She was nothing to John
Hartman.</p>

<p class="indent">The minister had poured the wine from the flask
into the chalice, and had broken the bread. He
lifted the chalice and the light flashed from its
bright surface.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drink ye all of it,&quot; he began gravely in his deep
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Katy heard no more. She put her arm
tightly round the tall post of the bed and clung and
clung to it as though a great creature or a great wave
threatened to drag her from her feet. She looked far
away across the wide bed, through the walls of the
great house, over the village and the fields to the
church on the hill. She was a child again in a red
dress, and she had run unsteadily out the brick
walk from her grandmother&#39;s kitchen door to the
gate, out to the blessed, free, forbidden open road.
She had talked to herself happily; she had stopped
to pull leaves which still lingered on the Virginia
creeper vines on the fences.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently, when she had trotted past the first
field, the open door of the church had attracted her.
She had been taken to church a few times; she
remembered the singing&mdash;even that early had the
strange performance of Henny Wenner fascinated
her; she now turned her steps toward the delightful
place. In the church an interesting man was at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
work with a little trowel and beautiful soft mortar,
and she had watched him until she had grown
sleepy, whereupon, with that feeling of possession
in all the world which had been hers so keenly in her
childhood, she had laid herself down on the soft
cushion of a pew.</p>

<p class="indent">When she woke the interesting little man with his
trowel was no longer in the church. Another man
had taken his place before the hole in the church
wall, and spying her suddenly had driven her out
with anger. She had not thought of it for years;
they had persuaded her that she had dreamed it;
had told her that if John Hartman had ever spoken
to her sharply, it was only to send her home where
she belonged, that he could have against her no
unkindly feeling.</p>

<p class="indent">But now it came back, strangely illumined. John
Hartman had driven her away angrily, and John
Hartman had held in his hand a silver cup, the shape
of the one which the preacher held to Cassie&#39;s pale
lips, but larger, handsomer. Upon it the sun had
flashed as the lamplight flashed now upon this
smaller cup.</p>

<p class="indent">At first Katy only remembered vaguely that there
had been trouble about the communion service, that
it had disappeared, that dishonest Alvin&#39;s dishonest
and crazy father had taken it. The thought of Alvin
brought to her mind a new set of sensations, confusing
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He held it in his hand,&quot; whispered Katy to herself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
&quot;Then he pushed it into the hole, quickly. I
saw him do it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She leaned her head against the tall bedpost, and
did not hear the command of the doctor to bring
water.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy!&quot; said he, again, a little more loudly.</p>

<p class="indent">Still Katy did not stir. The preacher looked up
also, and his communion service now over, came
quickly with an alarmed glance at Katy round the
great bed and took her by the arm. Her muscles
were stiff; she had only one conscious thought&mdash;to
cling to the thing nearest to her. The minister unclasped
her hand and half carrying her, half leading
her, took her down to the kitchen and laid her upon
the settle. When he had taken the water to the doctor,
he came back, to find Katy sitting up and looking
about her in a dazed fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had better lie down,&quot; bade the preacher.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy shook her head. &quot;I cannot lie down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This has been too much for you,&quot; went on
the preacher kindly. &quot;My wife is coming now to
stay. You cannot do anything more for poor Mrs.
Hartman. If I were you I would go home. When
the rest come I will walk down the street with
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy looked at him with somber eyes and did not
move.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This house is no place for you, Katy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy shivered; then she got to her feet. She
remembered her aching desire to console David, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
vague plans; she saw again the shining, silver chalice,
the startled, terrified face of David&#39;s father as
she tugged at his coat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; agreed Katy with a stiff tongue. &quot;You
have right. This house is no place for me.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX<br/>
THE SQUIRE AND DAVID TAKE A JOURNEY BY NIGHT</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On</span> Saturday evening David returned to Millerstown
and for the second time in his life entered his
father&#39;s house&mdash;his house now&mdash;by the front door.
There were friendly lights here and there; the squire,
who had met him at the train, slipped a kindly hand
under his arm as they ascended the steps and crossed
the porch. To the squire the Hartmans were queer,
unhuman. But David looked worn and miserable;
perhaps they suffered more than one thought. In his
first confusion after the disappearance of the communion
service, John Hartman had behaved so
strangely toward his old friend that the squire had
avoided him as a burnt child avoids the fire. But
that was long ago, and here was this boy come home
to his mother&#39;s funeral. The squire patted David&#39;s
shoulder as they entered the door.</p>

<p class="indent">David glanced with a shiver toward the room
upon the left where he had caught the first glimpse
of the bed upon which his father lay. But the door
was closed; Cassie had not been moved from the
catafalque upon which she died.</p>

<p class="indent">From the dim end of the long hall, a short figure
advanced to meet the two men. It was not Katy,
who had resigned her place, but Bevy, who had come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
to stay until the funeral was over. Bevy shook
hands with David solemnly, looking up at him with
awe, as the owner of farms and orchards and this
great house and unreckoned bank stock. She had
spread his supper in the kitchen, and the squire sat
with him while he ate. Then the two men went
upstairs together.</p>

<p class="indent">In Cassie&#39;s room a light burned faintly. The
squire turned it higher and then looked at David.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I go down, David?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said David.</p>

<p class="indent">The squire crossed the room slowly and laid back
the cover from Cassie&#39;s face; then both men stood
still, looking first at the figure on the bed, then at
each other. Cassie had always been beautiful, but
now an unearthly loveliness lighted her face. Her
dark hair was braided high on her head; her broad
forehead with its beautifully arched brows seemed to
shed an actual radiance. David had never observed
his mother&#39;s beauty, but now, in the last few months,
he had wakened to aspects to which he had been
blind. He had seen beautiful women; he could compare
them with his mother as she lay before him.
He looked at her hands, still shapely in spite of the
hard toil of her life, folded now across her quiet
breast; he noted the shape of her forehead; he saw
the smile with which she seemed to be contemplating
some secret and lovely thing.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon the squire the sight of Cassie made a deep
impression. Tears came into his eyes, and he shook
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
his head as though before him lay an unfathomable
mystery. He felt about her as he might have felt
about some young person cut off in youth. Here
was extraordinary promise, here was pitiful blight.
The squire had observed human nature in many
unusual and pathetic situations, here was the most
pathetic of all. The Hartmans could not be understood.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the squire, glancing at David, went out and
closed the door and left him with his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">In dumb confusion, David stood by the great bed.
More vaguely, the squire&#39;s puzzle was his also. His
mother had had an empty life&mdash;it should not have
been empty. He could not understand her, he could
not understand his father. They had put him away
from them. The old resentful, heart-breaking misery
came back; he had no people, he had no one who
loved him. Then resentment faded and grief filled
him. Like a lover, refused, rejected, he knelt down
beside the great bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, mother!&quot; cried David, again and again.
&quot;Oh, mother, mother!&quot; Then the old, unanswered,
unanswerable cry, &quot;Speak to me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">From the great bed came no sign. David rose
presently and laid back the cover over the smiling
lips and turned the light low and went down to join
the squire. Composedly he made plans with him for
the funeral. The squire announced that he and
Bevy had come to take up their abode unless David
wished to be alone. The squire looked at David,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
startled. In the last year David had grown more
than ever like his parents; he had his mother&#39;s
features and his father&#39;s deep gray eyes and thickly
curling hair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When you are through your school, you must
settle down in Millerstown,&quot; said the squire. &quot;There
ought to be little folks here in this house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David&#39;s heart leaped, then sank back to its place.
He had cured himself of Katy Gaumer; such flashes
were only meaningless recollections of past habit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am thinking of studying law,&quot; he told the
squire. &quot;That will keep me in school three years
more. And then I couldn&#39;t practice law in Millerstown.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Hartmans are not lawyers,&quot; said the squire.
&quot;The Hartmans are farmers. You would have
plenty to keep you busy, David.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">If old habit caused David to look for Katy
Gaumer, David&#39;s eyes were not gratified by what
they sought. Neither before his mother&#39;s funeral
nor afterward did she appear. Bevy had removed
her few belongings from David&#39;s room before he
returned; there remained in the Hartman house no
evidence of her presence. Bevy said that Katy was
tired, that she lay all day on the settle in her uncle&#39;s
kitchen. Bevy longed to pour out to David an account
of Katy&#39;s treatment at the hands of Alvin
Koehler, prospective church member though he
was. But she had been forbidden by the squire to
open her lips on the subject; and, besides, David
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
Hartman, the heir to all this magnificence, could
hardly be expected to take an interest in one who
had demeaned herself to become his mother&#39;s servant.
Nevertheless, a wild scheme formed itself in
Bevy&#39;s mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sometimes Katy cries,&quot; reported Bevy sentimentally
to David. &quot;It seems as though this
brought back everything about her gran&#39;mom and
everything. Yesterday she was real sick, but to-day
she complains better again. Katy has had a good
deal of trouble in this world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David frowned. He was going back to college in
the morning; his bag was already packed. Katy had
been in the house until the time of his mother&#39;s
death; she should have asked him to come to see her.
Old habit tempted him to play once more with fire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would like to see Katy,&quot; he said now to Bevy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well!&quot; Bevy faced him with arms akimbo, her
little eyes sparkling. &quot;I will tell Katy that she shall
come here once this evening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; answered David, who had got beyond the
simple ways of Millerstown. &quot;Ask her whether I
may come to see her this evening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, you can come to see her!&quot; cried Bevy.
&quot;I will just tell her you are coming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Bevy returned with an astonishing message.
Bevy was amazed at Katy&#39;s temerity. She had
planned that she would suggest to Edwin&#39;s Sally
that she and Edwin go to bed and leave the kitchen
to David and Katy.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
&quot;She only cried and said you should not come.
Sally said I must leave her alone. She said the squire
said and Edwin said that Katy must be left alone.
Katy is not herself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In June David returned to Millerstown with
trunks and boxes to stay for the summer, at least.
Upon his face a fresh record was written. He looked
older, his lips were more firmly set. His last term
had been easy; he had permitted himself holidays;
he had visited New York, had seen great ships, had
climbed great buildings, had learned, or thought
that he had learned, that money can buy anything
in the world. He had talked for defiance&#39; sake with
the pretty girl who had told him so sweetly long ago
that the college town was glad of his presence. The
pretty girl smiled upon him even more sweetly; it
was clear to David&#39;s eyes that his blunder was
nothing to her. He talked to other girls; it was
equally clear that they were glad to forget any
blunders of the past. He had not yet made up his
mind what he would do with this great world which
he could buy. Its evil was as plain to him as its
good, but he meant to have all of it. It was as
though David gathered together the pipe and cards
flung into the tree-tops from the Sheep Stable.</p>

<p class="indent">It was late in the afternoon when he arrived in
Millerstown. Main Street lay quiet and golden in
the sunshine. It was supper time and the Millerstonians
were indoors. Few persons saw him come,
and those few stood in too great awe of him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
invite him to their houses. He met Katy Gaumer
as he turned the corner sharply, and Katy gasped
and looked at him somberly, standing still in a
strange way to let him pass. She answered his
greeting without lifting her head. Old habit made
David grit his teeth.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon her doorstep sat the little Improved New
Mennonite, her supper finished. She was prettier
than ever. By nature a manager, she had reduced
Alvin&#39;s financial and other troubles to their simplest
terms, and there was now hope of a happy issue
from them. Alvin himself, though at peace, was not
exactly happy. He had been held so diligently to
his work, he had been compelled to dress so plainly
that he was much depressed in spirit. Red neckties
were now anathema; masculine adherents of the sect
of the Improved New Mennonites, indeed, abjured
neckties altogether, and Alvin feared that the black
one to which he was reduced would presently also be
taken from him. In her practical way Essie had long
since decided that the rented house in the village
could not be considered as an abode, but that the
little house on the mountain-side must be returned
to.</p>

<p class="indent">To the side of the little Mennonite came David
when he had opened the windows of his house. The
place was desolate. The baffling sense of his mother&#39;s
presence, even the consciousness of his father&#39;s, so
long past, were intolerable. He would not endure
this discomfort. He was young, ought to have happiness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
would have it. Essie Hill was lovely to look
at, she admired him, she was a woman; he would go
and talk to Essie. He wished that he had brought
her a present, but he could order one for her. If he
stayed in Millerstown this summer Essie would be a
pleasant diversion.</p>

<p class="indent">From the doorstep Essie looked up at him. Then,
as he prepared to sit down beside her, she drew
away, blushing primly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to be married,&quot; said she. &quot;I think I
ought to tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David grew suddenly pale. If a pigeon had turned
from his caress to attack him with talons, if a board
from his walk had arisen to smite him, he could not
have been more astounded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To whom?&quot; said he.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to marry Alvin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Alvin who?&quot; asked David, bewildered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Alvin Koehler.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then was David&#39;s pride wounded! He wished
Essie well with a steady voice, however, and went
on to the post-office and back to his house and sat
down on the dark back porch. How he hated them
all, these miserable people, but how he hated most
of all Alvin Koehler. It was not, he remembered,
the first time that Alvin had been preferred to him.
He thought again of William, gibbering and praying
in the corner of the almshouse garden. God had
put him there. It was a proof that God existed that
he had punished Alvin&#39;s father. And Alvin should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
be punished, too. David knew of the mortgage
among his father&#39;s papers. It was only by his
father&#39;s grace that the Koehlers had been allowed to
live so long on the mountain-side. That house
should continue in their possession no longer. Other
schemes for revenge came into his mind. He sat
miserably, his head buried in his hands as though
he were a tramp waiting for food instead of the heir
of the house come home to take possession.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not hear the sound of a step on the brick
walk. Suddenly, a girl screamed lightly and he
lifted his head, then sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot; he cried to the ghostly figure. &quot;Who
are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to scream,&quot; said Katy Gaumer.
&quot;I didn&#39;t see you at first and I was frightened. I
thought it was some stranger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is I,&quot; said David, gruffly. Katy&#39;s figure had
seemed like an apparition in the dim light; he had
been horribly startled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to see you, David,&quot; said Katy, hesitatingly.
&quot;I have something I must talk to you about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll make a light inside.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d rather talk here,&quot; said Katy. &quot;I&#39;ll sit here
on the step. I don&#39;t believe any one will come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David offered her a chair. The blood was pounding
in his temples, his wrists felt weak.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy had already seated herself on the low step.
David sat on a chair on the porch; he could see her
as she propped her elbows on her knees and made a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
cup for her chin with her hands. David breathed
deeply; old habit was reasserting itself. Then he
saw that Katy was trembling; to his amazement he
heard her crying.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You aren&#39;t well, Katy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Katy. &quot;But I have a duty to do. It
is hard. It nearly kills me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David&#39;s thoughts leaped wildly from one possibility
to another. What had she done? What could
she have done? Here was Katy in a new light, weeping,
distressed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, Katy? Don&#39;t be afraid to tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid to tell you.&quot; Katy turned her white
face toward him. &quot;But I must tell you. It has been
on my mind day and night. I have tried to think of
another way, but I cannot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When I was a little girl and lived with my
grandfather and grandmother, I used to run away,
and one day I ran away to the church. Alvin
Koehler&#39;s father was there plastering the wall, and
I watched him, and after a while I went to sleep in
a pew. When I woke up Alvin&#39;s father was gone,
but your father was there, David.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David gave a great start.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot say anything to me against my
father!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I must tell you, David. You will have to
decide what is to be done. I haven&#39;t told the squire
or any one, but you must know. It has been on my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
mind all this time. I can&#39;t rest or sleep any more. I
went up to your father and he spoke roughly to me,
and then I ran out and went home to my grandmother.
She laughed at me and said your father
was only chasing me home where I ought to be.
After a while I believed it. Then Alvin Koehler&#39;s
father got up at the funeral and talked about the
communion set and I didn&#39;t believe such a thing
for a minute, not a minute. Alvin is not&mdash;is not&mdash;very
honest&mdash;and I never believed it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You didn&#39;t believe what?&quot; said David with a
dry throat. &quot;What in this world are you talking
about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t believe for a minute that your father
would have anything to do with taking the communion
set. I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He didn&#39;t have anything to do with it,&quot; cried
David. &quot;What nonsense is this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy covered her face with her hands. She went
on mechanically as though she had prepared what
she had to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Before your mother died and the preacher came
to give her communion, he lifted the cup high in the
air and the light shone on it. Then I remembered
everything that I had forgotten, how I had run
away to the church and everything, and I knew that
your father had the shining cup in his hand when
I ran up to him. That was what I wanted&mdash;the
shining cup. He was there with it in his hand; it is
as plain as if it were now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
&quot;I do not believe you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To this Katy returned no answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell it long ago?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t remember this part till that night,&quot;
said Katy, patiently. &quot;But I couldn&#39;t come and
tell you then! I have thought over this and prayed
over it. If I could bear it for you, I would, David.
But I can&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not believe you,&quot; said David. &quot;You imagined
it. What could my father have wanted with
the communion service? What could he have done
with it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was a hole in the wall and he pushed it in
quickly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A hole in the wall!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Alvin&#39;s father was mending the wall. There
used to be a window there. I asked the squire about
the window. Alvin&#39;s father was closing it up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Into David&#39;s mind came a sickening recollection
of the wild-eyed, desperate figure which had risen
to shout out the terrible accusation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not believe it,&quot; he said again. &quot;You have
always helped Alvin Koehler. You helped him dishonestly
in school. You are trying to help him
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy&#39;s head bent a little lower over her knees.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He does not even have sense enough to care for
you or to be grateful to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy rose from her place on the low step. With
a gasp she started down the walk.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
&quot;What are you going to do about it?&quot; cried
David, hoarsely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing,&quot; answered Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are going now to tell the squire!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Katy, &quot;I am not going to tell any
one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why did you come here?&quot; David followed
her to the gate. &quot;You have made trouble, you are
always making trouble. If you are not going to do
anything about it, why did you come here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had to tell you,&quot; insisted Katy, woefully.
&quot;Can&#39;t you see that I had to tell you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not true,&quot; said David again. &quot;If you think
I will do anything against my father&#39;s name you are
mistaken. You&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Katy had gone. He heard the familiar click
of the gate, he heard her steps quicken. She was
running away as from a house of plague.</p>

<p class="indent">Then David hid his face in his arms and sat long
alone on the porch. He saw his father&#39;s stern face.
His father had gone about&mdash;this there was no denying&mdash;like
a man with a heavy load upon his
heart. But that he should have had anything to
do with the theft of a communion service, that he
should even have touched it, that he, himself, knowing
the truth, should have allowed another to be
suspected&mdash;this was monstrous.</p>

<p class="indent">With rapid step David went up and down the
porch. He would go away from Millerstown forever,
that was certain. He would sell his house, his farms;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
he would shake the dust of the place from his feet.
But first he would clear the mind of Katy Gaumer
from this outrageous suspicion and make it impossible
for the slander to travel farther. As he made his
plans, he stood still at the top of the porch steps,
his head bent. Then he lifted his head with a sudden
motion. There was for an instant a strangeness
in the air, a sense of human presence. David felt
blessed in his endeavor.</p>

<p class="indent">A few moments later he opened the door of the
squire&#39;s office.</p>

<p class="indent">The squire, busy with his favorite occupation, the
planning of a journey, sat with his feet comfortably
elevated on the table. He let his chair slam to the
floor and came forward to meet his guest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, David, now you are a graduate! Let me
look at you! Now you are to stay with us. Why,
David!&quot; The squire stared at the countenance before
him. &quot;Are you in trouble?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered David.</p>

<p class="indent">With the squire in his chair behind the desk, himself
on the old settle, David told his story.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy Gaumer came to the house this evening
and told me a strange thing. She says that she saw
my father with the communion cup in his hand the
day that the service disappeared from the church.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The communion cup?&quot; repeated the squire,
startled almost out of his wits. &quot;What communion
cup?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The one that disappeared.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
The squire gasped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy saw him!&quot; Here was Katy again, Katy
who had seemed to them all to be such a promising
child, Katy who was determined to go away to
school, Katy who helped young rascals from her
poverty, Katy who now would not study, who
refused to do anything but sit dismally about!
&quot;Katy Gaumer,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Our Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Katy Gaumer,&quot; said David. &quot;She says she
was a little child and that she ran away from her
grandmother to the church and saw my father put
the silver cup into a hole made by plastering up the
window.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Impossible!&quot; cried the squire. &quot;Nonsense!
Humbug! The girl is crazy. It couldn&#39;t be!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David looked at him and drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was what I said. Then I thought of
Koehler, and of how he had gone mad, and I knew
my father would wish it investigated.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">An electric shock tingled the squire&#39;s sensorium.
He remembered the contorted face, the trembling
hands, the terrible earnestness with which Koehler
made his attack upon the dead man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is your plan, David?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought we might get the key of the church
and go out there and look about. It&#39;s bright moonlight
and I believe we can see without making a
light. I don&#39;t believe I can sleep until I have been
out there and have looked about. I suppose we will
have to get a key from the preacher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
&quot;I have a key,&quot; said the squire. &quot;But let us wait
till to-morrow, David.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must go to-night,&quot; insisted David.</p>

<p class="indent">Only once were words exchanged on the journey.
The two men went out the village street, past
Grandfather Gaumer&#39;s, where a hundred sweet odors
saluted them from the garden and where Katy lay
weeping on her bed, to the path along the pike,
between the open fields.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You knew my father,&quot; said David. &quot;Such a
thing could not have been possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I knew him from a boy,&quot; answered the squire
heartily and honestly. &quot;Such a thing could not have
been possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Had Koehler ever made this accusation before
the time of my father&#39;s funeral?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He made it to the preacher after the service
disappeared, but the preacher told him he must be
still.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Could Koehler have had any motive for taking
it himself?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was a poor man,&quot; answered the squire. &quot;But
he was simple and honest&mdash;all the Koehlers were.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you suppose became of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have always supposed that some one sneaked
in while Koehler was away for a minute. A tramp
could easily have walked in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did my father never say that he had been in the
church that afternoon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not that I know of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
The church door opened easily and quietly, the
church was dim and silent. The tall, narrow windows,
fitted with clear glass, let in the light of the
moon upon the high pulpit, the oaken pews, the
bare floor. The pulpit and the Bible were draped
with protecting covers of white which made the
church seem more ghostly and mysterious. Katy
Gaumer in certain moods would have been enchanted.</p>

<p class="indent">Together the two men looked at the smooth wall
beside the pulpit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn&#39;t seem as if that wall could ever have
been broken,&quot; said David in a low voice. &quot;Was the
window there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered the squire. &quot;There was a window
there. But William Koehler was a fine plasterer.
The window went almost from ceiling to floor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We would have to have a pickaxe and other
tools. And we would have to ask for permission to
open it. And all Millerstown would have to know,&quot;
said David.</p>

<p class="indent">The squire pondered for an instant. &quot;We would
if we opened it from this side. But the Sunday
School is built against the other side, and there
there is only a little thin wainscoting to break
through. It could be taken out and put back easily.
There are tools here in the church somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The squire returned to the vestibule and opened
the door of a cupboard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here is a whole basket of tools. I do not like to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
make a light or every one will see. Millerstown is
wonderful curious.&quot; The squire&#39;s light tone sounded
strangely in the silence of the church, strangely to
David and strangely to himself. &quot;Don&#39;t you think,
David&quot;&mdash;the squire had his hand on the knob of
the Sunday-School room door&mdash;&quot;don&#39;t you think
we had better wait till to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; answered David.</p>

<p class="indent">The squire passed on into the little Sunday-School
room and David followed him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s brighter here.&quot; The squire measured the
wainscoting with his eye. &quot;The old window ought
to be about here. Sit down, David.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David obeyed, trembling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe I could open it,&quot; said he.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course not!&quot; answered the squire, cheerfully.
&quot;Do not worry, David. That silver has been melted
this long time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The squire thrust a chisel into a crevice and lifted
out a section of wainscoting, then another. When
three or four narrow strips were removed, he thrust
his hand into the aperture. The moonlight grew
brighter as the moon cleared the upper boughs of
the old cherry trees outside the Sunday-School
building; it shone upon a curious scene, the old man
at his strange task, the young man watching so
eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There can&#39;t be anything here,&quot; said the squire,
cheerfully. &quot;There can&#39;t be. This might just as
well be made into a book cupboard for the Sunday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
School; it is wasted space. It&#39;s queer we never
thought of that. You see the church wall is four
bricks thick here, and William&#39;s wall only one brick.
It&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The squire ceased suddenly to speak. His exploring
hand had only now reached the bottom of
the deep hole; it came into contact with a substance
different from the fallen rubble which he expected to
touch. David heard his voice die away, saw him
start.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is something here,&quot; answered the squire.</p>

<p class="indent">David looked at the yawning hole with what
courage he could muster. The squire thrust in his
hand a little deeper, and groped about. Then, from
the pit from which John Hartman might have
lifted them easily had not all thought been paralyzed,
he drew in their gray bag a pitcher, black
with tarnish, and a silver plate, and set them on
the floor beside him, and then a silver chalice. Still
feeling about, he touched a paper and that, too, he
lifted out and laid on the floor with the silver vessels.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, silently, he and David looked at each other.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX<br/>
THE MYSTERY DEEPENS</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">For</span> a long time neither the squire nor David spoke
or moved. David sat on the bench where he had
sat, a little boy at Sunday School, and the squire
remained kneeling, forgetting his aching bones.
When sharp pain reminded him of his years and his
rheumatism, he rose and sat by David on the low,
shallow bench.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t understand it,&quot; said he again and again.
&quot;One cannot believe it. There wasn&#39;t any motive.
He couldn&#39;t have wanted to steal it&mdash;such a thing
would be entirely impossible. He was already rich;
he was always well-behaved from his childhood
up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David did not answer. His face was in the shadow,
only his tightly clasped hands were illuminated by
the bright moonlight. His mind was confused, he
could not yet coördinate his impressions. There was
Katy Gaumer&#39;s story, there was Koehler&#39;s terrible
accusation; here was this damning proof of both.
He felt again that rising, protesting pride in his
father, he felt a sickening unwillingness to go on
with this investigation, which seemed to mean in
his first confusion only an intolerable humbling of
himself before Alvin Koehler, the effeminate, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
smiling, the son of a madman and a thief. Poor
David groaned.</p>

<p class="indent">At once the squire rose with a troubled sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;d better put these things back and drive in
a few nails to hold the wainscoting. We&#39;ll surely
meet some one if we carry them into town and then
the cat would be out of the bag.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David agreed with a nod.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And here is this paper!&quot; The squire started.
Perhaps they were nearer an explanation than they
thought. &quot;Put it in your pocket, David.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David thrust the paper into his pocket with a
sort of sob. The squire laid the precious vessels back
on the rough floor of the little pit and put the wainscoting
in place. A few light taps with a hammer
and all was smooth once more as it had been for
fifteen years. Then he led the way into the dim
church.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, David!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David did not answer. He had sat down once
more on the low bench. His thoughts had passed
beyond himself; he sat once more beside his father&#39;s
body here in the church. He experienced again that
paralyzing horror of death, the passionate desire to
shield his poor father from the curious eyes of
Millerstown, his rage at the wild, dusty figure in the
gallery. He remembered William Koehler as he had
seen him later in the corner of the poorhouse garden,
waving his arms, struggling like some frantic creature
striving to break the bonds which held him. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
saw the face of Alvin, empty, dissatisfied, vain. He
remembered the little house, its poverty, its meanness.
He remembered how he had called upon God
to prove Himself to him by punishing Alvin
Koehler&#39;s father. David was proud no more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, David!&quot; urged the squire again, returning;
and this time David followed him, through the
church, out into the warm June night. Cinder was
being dumped at the furnace, the sky flushed suddenly
a rosy red, then the glow faded, leaving only
the silvery moonlight. It was only nine o&#39;clock;
pleasant sounds rose from the village, the laughter
of children, the voice of some one singing. Millerstown
was going on in its quiet, happy way. At
Grandfather Gaumer&#39;s all was dark; the house stood
somberly among its pine trees; the garden still
breathed forth its lovely odors. The two men proceeded
into the little office of the squire, and there
the squire lit his lamp and both sat down.</p>

<p class="indent">Trembling, David drew from his pocket the paper
which the squire had found with the silver vessels.
John Hartman had expected that long before the
silver service was discovered the threatening letter
would be destroyed. But here it lay in his son&#39;s
hand, its fiber intact. It had caused John Hartman
hideous suffering; it was to hide it that he had given
his life&#39;s happiness; here now it lay in the hand of
David. Slowly David unfolded the yellowed sheet
and looked at it.</p>

<p class="indent">The squire, startled by a cry, turned from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
door he was locking against possible intruders.
David&#39;s blond head lay on the squire&#39;s desk, the
paper beside it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, David?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David held out the paper, his face still hidden.
The squire felt for his spectacles, his hand shaking.
Here now was the explanation of this strange mystery,
a mystery thought to be forever inexplicable.
Why had John Hartman done this thing? The
squire held his breath in suspense.</p>

<p class="indent">But the squire read no answer to his questions.
The paper, old and yellowed and flabby to the
touch, could be scrutinized forever, held to the light,
magnified, but it told nothing. On it only a few
words were legible, a portion of those written by
John Hartman as he sat by the roadside in his
misery long ago.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear little boy.&quot; &quot;My poor Cassie.&quot; There
was one fragment of a sentence. &quot;What shall I&mdash;&quot; and
there all ended.</p>

<p class="indent">The squire looked at the paper solemnly. The
mystery had only thickened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was in some trouble, poor Hartman was,&quot;
said he. &quot;He was in great trouble. I wish he had
come to me in his trouble.&quot; Again and again the
squire turned the paper over in his hand, still he
found nothing but the few, scattered words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I will ask Katy to come over,&quot; said he.
&quot;Perhaps she can remember something more of
this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
David did not lift his head to answer; he did not
hear what the squire said. He tried desperately to
control himself, to decide what must next be done.
When Katy came in with the squire, he was startled
almost out of his senses and sprang up hastily. Of
all the ignominy of his life Katy had been a witness.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy had not gone to bed to stay, but had only
hurled herself down once more upon her oft-used
refuge. It was evident that she had shed many
tears. The squire drew her to a seat beside him on
the settle and kept hold of her. It was always natural
for any one who was near Katy to find her hand or
to touch the curls on her neck or to make her more
comfortable with one&#39;s arm. To David, as she sat
by the squire, she was an impregnably fortressed
and cruel judge.</p>

<p class="indent">Again Katy told her story&mdash;all her story, her
running away, her talking with William Koehler,
her falling asleep, her sight of the shining cup.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You say he <i>pushed</i> it in, Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He had it in his hand and he dropped it in
quickly. Then he&mdash;he sent me away. I am sure I
ought not to have been in the church; it was all right
for him to send me away. I remembered it all but
the shining cup. If gran&#39;mom was alive, she could
tell you how I came running home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you never told any one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I spoke often of his having sent me home,&quot; explained
Katy. &quot;But I never remembered about the
shining cup until the preacher came to see David&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
mother. Then I couldn&#39;t tell David,&mdash;I <i>couldn&#39;t</i>
tell him! But perhaps it isn&#39;t there; perhaps even
if he had the cup in his hand he hadn&#39;t anything
to do with the other; perhaps&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The silver is there,&quot; said the squire sadly. &quot;We
found it in the bottom of the pit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear! oh, dear!&quot; cried Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">David looked at her coldly. She sat with her
curly head hidden against the squire&#39;s shoulder.
David wished that she would go, that she would
remove herself far from him, forever. He had suffered
this evening to the limit of endurance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You did your duty,&quot; said he in the tone learned
at college. &quot;You needn&#39;t feel any further responsibility.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus propelled, Katy rose and checked her tears
and passed out of the squire&#39;s office.</p>

<p class="indent">When she had gone, David took up his burden
manfully, though somewhat savagely. David was
proud once more, but the pride was that of honor,
not of haughtiness. John Hartman had had a code
of honor; it was that which had broken his heart.
Millerstown had a similar code of honor. By inheritance
or by observation had David learned the
way of a just man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now,&quot; said he, &quot;we will find Alvin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-night, David?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Alvin will know nothing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we will find Alvin.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br/>
THE SQUIRE AND DAVID TAKE A JOURNEY BY DAY</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">David</span> and the squire had not gone far in their
search for Alvin before David&#39;s mind changed.
He did not care to seek him at the house of the little
Improved New Mennonite or to ask the squire to
take the long walk to Alvin&#39;s house on the mountainside.
It would be better to follow the squire&#39;s suggestion
and wait until morning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then we will drive out to the poorhouse and see
Koehler himself. He is the one to see. You&#39;d better
stay here to-night with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David shook his head. He wished to be alone;
he had set a task for himself. Perhaps some letter
or document had escaped him among those in his
father&#39;s safe, some letter or document which could
throw light on the strange past.</p>

<p class="indent">But David found nothing. He entered again into
his great house, locked its doors, and opened the
iron safe. There he read through ledgers and day
books and mortgages and deeds in vain. He found
nothing but the orderly papers of a careful business
man. He looked again at the letter upon which the
secret had been written, he held it up between him
and the lamp, but the original writing was gone forever.
It had been a letter,&mdash;of that there was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
doubt,&mdash;his father&#39;s writing followed the spaces
of a margin, but the text of the letter was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">In the morning the two men drove out the country
road to the almshouse. The fields were green,
wild roses and elder were in bloom, the air was
sweet. A man could ask nothing better of fate than
to be given a home and work in such a spot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They say Koehler has grown quieter,&quot; said the
squire. &quot;He doesn&#39;t rave and pray this long time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David did not answer. If another had visited such
shame upon him, it would have been a long time
before he would have grown quiet. David was now
pale, now scarlet; he moistened his lips as though he
were feverish. Reparation must be made, but what
adequate reparation could be offered? Of money
there was plenty, and Alvin, alas! could be satisfied
with money; Alvin would probably never understand
the awful hurt which had been done him. But his
father&mdash;how could reason be returned to him?</p>

<p class="indent">In his corner in the almshouse garden they found
William. The almshouse was a pleasant place with
shady lawns and comfortable porches upon which
old men could smoke their pipes and old women
could sit knitting or shelling peas, or helping in other
ways with the work for the large family. William
Koehler never sat with the rest. He worked all day
and then went back to his room like any self-respecting
laborer. He was disinclined to speak; he was
happiest on long, sunny days when he could be in
the garden from dawn till twilight.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
Now he was on his knees, weeding his cabbage
plants. Another man would have done the work
quickly with a hoe, but not so William. The delightful
labor lasted longer if he pulled each weed by
hand. Frequently he paused, to press down the soil
a little more solidly about the roots of a plant or to
say what sounded like an encouraging word. Thus
had he been accustomed to talk to his chickens and
his bees.</p>

<p class="indent">When the squire and David approached, he
looked up from his work with a frown. At David he
merely glanced; at the squire he stared. When
he recognized him, he smiled faintly and rose from
his knees.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, William,&quot; said the squire, cheerfully. &quot;Do
you know me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To be sure I know you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come over here and sit down, William.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am very busy this morning,&quot; objected William,
uneasily.</p>

<p class="indent">He answered the squire in Pennsylvania German.
The years which had almost anglicized Millerstown
had had no educating effect upon the residents of
the county home.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I want to talk to you a little.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The squire took him in a friendly way by the arm,
at which an expression of terror came into William&#39;s
eyes, and he jerked away from the squire&#39;s grasp.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will come,&quot; he promised. &quot;But I will come
myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
The squire led the way across the lawn to the
shade of a great tree where two benches were placed
at right angles. Upon one the squire and David sat
down, upon the other William. The line between
William&#39;s eyes deepened, his lips trembled, he
pressed his hands, palm to palm, between his knees.
The squire and David looked at each other. The
squire, too, had grown pale; he shook his head
involuntarily over the task which they were beginning.
He, too, had had a share in William&#39;s condemnation,
as had all Millerstown. The squire felt
helpless. He remembered the mocking boys, the
scornful, incredulous people; he recalled the gradual
taking away of William&#39;s business by the new mason
whom Millerstown imported and encouraged. The
squire thought as David had of the years that could
never be returned, of the reason which could never
be restored. He took a long time to begin what he
had to say. When William half rose as though to
escape back to his garden, the squire came to himself
and his duty with a start.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;William, do you remember anything about the
window that you plastered shut in the church and
about the communion set?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">William lifted his hands, then joined them on
his breast. He shook now as with palsy. David,
watching him, looked away to hide his tears. David
was young, the wreck of William Koehler seemed
a unique, horrible case.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently William answered in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
&quot;God told me to be quiet. I prayed and prayed
and God told me to be quiet. I am quiet now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, William, you must tell us what you can
remember. It will be for your good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">William opened his arms in a wild gesture, then
clasped his hands again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A voice told me to forget it. I prayed till I
heard a voice telling me to be quiet. You are tempting
me! You are tempting me to disobey God. God
said to be quiet about it!&quot; He covered his face with
his hands and began to weep aloud in a terrible way.</p>

<p class="indent">David crossed the little space between them and
sat down beside him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You didn&#39;t take the communion set,&quot; he said.
&quot;We know you didn&#39;t take it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">William Koehler drew his hands away from his
eyes and looked round at the young face beside him.
Some tone of the voice startled him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who are you?&quot; he asked in astonishment. As
he put the question he moved slowly and cautiously
away, as though he planned to flee. &quot;What do you
mean to do with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Together David and the squire rose. It was clear
that William had heard as much as he could endure.
His hands twitched, his eyes were as wild as any
lunatic&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn&#39;t make any difference who I am,&quot; said
David, steadily. &quot;You are to remember that all the
people know you did not take the communion set.
You are to think of that all the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
Again William began to weep, but in a different
way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot think of it,&quot; he sobbed. &quot;God told me
not to think of it. God told me to forgive him. I
have forgiven him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As the squire and David drove through the gate,
William was kneeling once more among his cabbages.
Sometimes he stopped and rubbed his head in a
puzzled way, then his hands returned to caress the
young plants.</p>

<p class="indent">Almost silently the two men drove back to Millerstown
and up to the little white house on the mountain
road. Standing before the door, David saw
once more its littleness, its meanness. It seemed as
though it could never have been altogether proof
against the storms of winter. Looking back at his
own great mansion among the trees he shivered.
Imagination woke within him; he comprehended
something of the lonely misery of poor William. It
was a salutary though dreadful experience for David.</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin answered their knock at once. In a half-hearted,
inefficient way he was trying to put the
house into habitable condition. For the first time
in his life he thought with respect of his father and
of his father&#39;s work. His father could have applied
the needed plaster and boards skillfully and quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">When Alvin saw who stood without he looked
at them blankly. The difference between his worn
clothes and David&#39;s fine apparel hurt him. He was
always afraid of the squire. Together the three sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
down on the porch. Here David was the spokesman.
To him the squire listened with admiration and
respect.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Alvin, the communion service has been found.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin looked at them more blankly than ever.
The affair of the communion service belonged to the
dim past; since he had thought of the communion
service he had been away to school, and had been
educated and jilted, and cruelly maltreated by Bevy
Schnepp, and had become engaged once more. It
was a long time before Alvin could remember the
very close relation he bore to the communion service.
When he remembered, his heart sank. He
recalled clearly his father&#39;s trying, desperate appeal
on Christmas Day so long ago. Had they come to
make him pay for his father&#39;s theft?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your father insisted that my father had been in
the church and had taken it,&quot; explained David.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never believed it,&quot; cried Alvin at once. He
was now terrified. Were they going to make him
suffer for his father&#39;s madness. &quot;I never believed it!
Pop could never get me to believe it,&quot; he assured
them earnestly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it is true, Alvin,&quot; insisted David. &quot;Your
father had nothing to do with it. He spoke the truth
when he said that he knew nothing about it. A great
wrong was done your father. I want to try to make
part of it right with you and him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin gaped at them. It was difficult to comprehend
this amazing offer.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
&quot;I have been to see your father, Alvin,&quot; David
went on. &quot;I hope you will forgive my father and
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David spoke steadily. The request was easy to
make now; even greater humbling of himself would
have been easy.</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin responded in his own way. He remembered
his long poverty, his lack of the things he wanted,
the cruel price he had had to pay for his first beautiful
red necktie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My father spent a great deal of money for detectives,&quot;
he said, ruefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will be restored to him,&quot; said David.
&quot;Everything that I can do, I will do, Alvin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When their errand was made perfectly clear to
Alvin, he was terrified again, now by his good fortune.
He was to have money, money to do what he
liked with, more money than he actually needed!
The mortgage was to be destroyed&mdash;the mention of
that instrument had alarmed him for the moment.
Was he only to be relieved of a burden of whose
existence he had been to this time unaware? But
there was more to come! The sum his father had
spent was to be guessed at liberally and was to be
put on interest for his father&#39;s support, and Alvin
himself was to have recompense.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you like teaching?&quot; asked David. &quot;Is there
anything you would rather do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin clasped his hands as though to assure himself
by physical sensation that he was awake and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
that the words he heard were real. He cherished no
malice, hoarded no hatred&mdash;that much could be
said for Alvin who failed in many other ways.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, how I would like to have a store!&quot; he cried.
&quot;If I could borrow the money from you to have a
store, a store to sell clothes and shoes and such
things! I do not like teaching. I am not a teacher.
The children are naughty all the time for me. I&mdash;&quot;
Suddenly Alvin halted. No more in this world could
he go his own sweet way; liberty now offered was
already curtailed. A fixed star controlled now the
steady orbit of his life. His bright color faded. &quot;We
would better talk to her about it,&quot; said he.</p>

<p class="indent">David Hartman forgot for an instant the Pennsylvania
German idiom. It is an evidence of the
monogamous nature of the true Pennsylvania German
that the personal pronoun of the third person,
used alone, applies but to one human being.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To her?&quot; repeated David, puzzled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, to Essie Hill. I am going to be married to
Essie Hill.&quot; Alvin rose. &quot;Perhaps we could go down
there,&quot; he proposed hesitatingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Together the trio went down the mountain road.
The squire drove the buggy, Alvin and David
walked. The squire kept ahead, so that the curtains
on the back of the buggy sheltered him from the
view of his companions. Thus hidden, he laughed
until the buggy shook. To the squire Alvin could
never be a tragic figure; he belonged on the stage of
comedy or broad farce.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span>
When the squire reached the house of the preacher
of the Improved New Mennonites, he dismounted,
tied his horse, and awaited the arrival of the young
men. Then the three went in on the board walk to
the kitchen, where Essie was singing, &quot;They ask us
why we&#39;re happy.&quot; Again the squire&#39;s face quivered.</p>

<p class="indent">Essie received her three guests in her calm, composed
way. She put the interesting scallops on the
edge of her cherry pie with a turn of her thumb, and
invited the three gentlemen to have seats. Essie was
neither an imaginative nor an inquisitive person.
Her life was ordered, her thoughts did not circle far
beyond herself. The tragedy suggested by the juxtaposition
of these three persons did not occur to her.
She sat primly with her hands folded and heard her
visitors for their cause. Her eyes narrowed as she
listened to David&#39;s statement of Alvin&#39;s desire for
a store. It was true that Alvin did not like teaching,
was not a success as a teacher. Essie had intended
to think out some other way for him to earn the
family living. Selling fine clothes would not be a sin
like wearing them; indeed, one could preach a sermon
by refraining from what was so near at hand
and so tempting. That such a policy might be damaging
to the family pocketbook, Essie did not realize
for the moment. Essie was always most anxious
that the sermon should be preached. Millerstown,
however, fortunately for Alvin&#39;s success as a haberdasher,
was set in its iniquity as far as the wearing
of good clothes was concerned.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
&quot;I think it would be a very good thing for Alvin
to have a store,&quot; said she.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to do everything I can to make up for
the past,&quot; explained David. &quot;I can&#39;t make it right
entirely. I wish I could.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To Essie the balancing of accounts always appealed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is right,&quot; said she.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But there is Alvin&#39;s father,&quot; David went on.
&quot;We cannot leave him where he is if he can be persuaded
to come away. He doesn&#39;t understand yet
that we have discovered that he was not guilty, but
we hope he may.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Essie answered without pause. Essie had as clear
an idea of her own duty as she had of other people&#39;s&mdash;a
rather uncommon quality.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will take him home to us,&quot; said she.</p>

<p class="indent">When the interview was over, David went with
the squire to partake of Bevy&#39;s dinner. The squire
and his two companions had not been unobserved
in their progress through Millerstown. Sarah Ann
Mohr, on her way to David&#39;s house with a loaf of
fresh bread and a Schwenkfelder cake and two pies
and a mess of fresh peas from her garden and with
great curiosity in her kindly heart about David&#39;s
future movements, saw the three, and stood still in
her tracks and cried out, &quot;Bei meiner Sex!&quot; which
meaningless exclamation well expressed the confusion
of her mind. When they vanished into Essie&#39;s
kitchen, she cried out, &quot;What in the world!&quot;&mdash;and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span>
basket in hand, plates rattling, instant destruction
threatening her pies, she flew back to the house of
Susannah Kuhns. Susannah hurried to the house
of Sarah Knerr, and together all sought Bevy, as
the only woman connected with any of the three
men. Other Millerstonians saw them assembled and
the conference grew in numbers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The squire and David and Alvin Koehler together
at the Mennonite&#39;s!&quot; cried Susannah.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps he is to marry her and Alvin,&quot; suggested
a voice at the edge of the crowd.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;David used to sit with her, too, sometimes,&quot;
Sarah Knerr reminded the others. &quot;Perhaps there
is trouble and it will give a court hearing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humbug!&quot; cried Bevy. &quot;You don&#39;t know anything
about it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bevy, of course, knew nothing about it either.</p>

<p class="indent">Almost bursting with curiosity, Bevy made her
noodle soup. It was only because she was not a literary
person that the delicious portions of dough
which gave the soup its name were not cut into
exclamation points and question marks. Bevy was
suffering; when the squire brought David home with
him, her uneasiness became distressing to see. Presently
she was thrown into a state bordering on
insanity.</p>

<p class="indent">David laid down his fork and looked across the
table at her restless figure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bevy,&quot; said he in an ordinary tone, &quot;the communion
set has been found.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span>
&quot;What!&quot; screamed Bevy.</p>

<p class="indent">All her speculations had arrived at no such wonderful
conclusion as this. The squire looked startled;
he had wondered how the report would first reach
Millerstown.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did Koehler tell?&quot; demanded Bevy. &quot;Did he
tell where he put it? Is it any good yet? Will they
use it? Did you come to it by accident? Did&mdash;&quot;
Bevy&#39;s breath failed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Koehler had nothing to do with it,&quot; said David.
&quot;My father put it into the hole made by plastering
up the window in the church. There it lay all these
years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He never meant to take it!&quot; screamed Bevy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; agreed David; &quot;I do not believe he meant
to take it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What <i>did</i> he mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doesn&#39;t anybody know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nobody knows,&quot; interposed the squire. &quot;Now,
Bevy, get the pie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Immediately Bevy started for her kitchen. When
after a few minutes she had not reappeared, the
squire followed her. The kitchen was empty, no
Bevy was to be seen; but from across the yard a
loud chattering issued from Edwin&#39;s Sally&#39;s kitchen.</p>

<p class="indent">In the evening the squire and the preacher came
and sat with David on his porch. The communion
set had been taken from its hiding-place and the
preacher&#39;s wife had polished it until it was once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg&nbsp;319]</span>
more bright and beautiful. Millerstown dropped in
by twos and threes to behold it, each with his own
eyes. The squire and the preacher and David talked
about many things of interest to Millerstown and
to the world at large. When the two men went away
together, they said that David had astonished them.</p>

<p class="indent">Later in the evening another man entered the
gate and came up to the porch. Oliver Kuhns, the
elder, sat down in the chair which the squire had left.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I heard a strange thing to-day,&quot; said he, brokenly.
&quot;I cannot understand it. When I was in
great trouble, your father helped me. If you want I
shall tell Millerstown, I will. I took my money when
my father died and went to New York and bad people
got me, and when I came home to my wife and
little children, I had nothing. Your father lent it to
me so she should not find it out, and he would
never take it again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He would not want you to tell Millerstown,&quot;
said David.</p>

<p class="indent">As Oliver Kuhns, the elder, went out the gate,
Jacob Fackenthal came in. He would not sit down.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your pop saved me from jail, David,&quot; said he.
&quot;Anything I can do for you, I will. Nobody in
Millerstown believes that he meant to take the
communion set. If you will stay in Millerstown,
Millerstown will show you what it thinks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After a long time David went into the great house,
through the front door, up the broad stairway to
the handsome room which he had selected for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span>
own. He could not understand his mother and
father; still, in a measure, they put him away from
them. Dimly he comprehended their tragedy, error
on one side, refusal to forgive on the other, and
heartbreak for both. He thought long of his father
and mother. But when he went to sleep, he was
thinking of William Koehler and his son Alvin and
planning the fitting-out of a little store and the
planting of a garden and the purchasing of a flock
of chickens and several hives of bees. Old ghosts
were laid, old unhappinesses forgotten; from David&#39;s
consciousness there had vanished even Katy Gaumer,
who in a strange way had brought him a
blessing.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br/>
KATY IS TO BE EDUCATED AT LAST</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Two</span> months passed before Millerstown settled
down, from the excited speculation which followed
Katy Gaumer&#39;s flash of memory and its remarkable
effects, into its usual level of excitement. Millerstown
was usually excited over something. By the
end of two months Sarah Ann and Bevy and
Susannah Kuhns had ceased to gather on one another&#39;s
porches or in one another&#39;s houses to discuss
the strange Hartmans. By the end of three months
all possible explanations had been offered, all possible
questions answered, or proved unanswerable.
Had Cassie known of the hiding-place of the silver
service? Had Cassie died of a broken heart? Did
persons ever die of broken hearts? Why, and again
why, why, why, did John Hartman push the silver
service into the hole? And why, having pushed it in,
did John Hartman not take it out? Why had not
Katy remembered the strange incident long before
this?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My belief is it <i>was</i> to be so,&quot; said Susannah
Kuhns, a vague conclusion which Millerstown
applied to all inexplicable affairs.</p>

<p class="indent">In all their speculations, no one ever thought of
John Hartman or alluded to John Hartman as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg&nbsp;322]</span>
thief. For once, Millerstown accepted the incomprehensible.
Of the sad causes of John Hartman&#39;s
behavior Millerstown knew nothing, could never
know anything.</p>

<p class="indent">Sarah Ann, being more tender-hearted than the
rest, and seeing a little more deeply into the lives
of her fellow men and women, thought longest about
the Hartmans. Sarah Ann&#39;s husband had been a disagreeable
and parsimonious man and Sarah Ann knew
something of the misery of a divided hearthstone.
She often laid down the Millerstown &quot;Star,&quot; fascinating
as it was with its new stories, of a man driven
by house cleaning to suicide in a deep well, of a dog
which spoke seven words, or of a snake creeping
up a church aisle, and took off her spectacles and
thought of the Hartmans and of the Koehlers and of
Katy Gaumer&#39;s strange part in their affairs.</p>

<p class="indent">Millerstown was not entirely deprived of subject-matter
by its exhaustion of the Hartman mystery.
David Hartman had employed a housekeeper and
had opened his great mansion from top to bottom.
All Millerstown walked past during the first few
days of his occupancy to see whether it was true
that there were lights in the parlor and that the
squire and the preacher went in and out the front
door to visit David. David had been carefully
inspecting his orchards and farms, had visited again
the land on the mountain-side with its double
treasure. David had brought his riding-horse to
Millerstown and Millerstown flew once more to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span>
doors and windows to see him pass. David consulted
with his farmers; David asked a thousand questions
of the squire; David was busy from morning till
night.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And David is nice and common,&quot; boasted Bevy
Schnepp, who behaved as though she were David&#39;s
mother and grandmother and maiden aunt in one.
&quot;He is never proud; you would never know he was
so rich and educated.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David had gone himself in midsummer to bring
William Koehler home to his house on the mountain-side.
William seemed to understand now the startling
information brought him by the squire and
David. At last he realized who David was, and all
the kindliness of his intentions. As he drove up the
street, his old neighbors came out with pitying looks
to speak to him and at his home his daughter-in-law
received him with her placid kindness.</p>

<p class="indent">An addition had been built to the little house, but
otherwise all was as it had been. The garden had
been restored, onions and peas and tomatoes had
been planted, though July was at hand, so that
William might find immediate occupation. Back in
the chicken house were cheerful duckings and crowings,
and about the hives the bees buzzed as of old.</p>

<p class="indent">At first William tended his garden and sat on the
porch in the sunshine and was satisfied and happy.
Then he grew restless; the line deepened again in
his forehead. It was plainly to be seen that all was
not right with William.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg&nbsp;324]</span>
But all was made right. One afternoon Sarah
Ann Mohr put on her sunbonnet and donned a
white apron over her immaculate gingham one and
took a basket on her arm and an umbrella in her
hand, to be used now for sunshade, now for staff,
and climbed the mountain road. She talked with
William and gave Essie a little housewifely advice
about the making of soap, in which occupation Essie
was engaged; she emptied her basket, then she rose
to go.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;William,&quot; said Sarah Ann, &quot;I have a little plastering
that should have been done this long time.
I wonder if you would have the time to do it for me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was not every one, Bevy Schnepp said proudly
afterwards, who would ride on horseback to Allentown
to fetch a mason&#39;s white suit and the best kind
of trowel, but David had them ready for William in
the morning. William accepted them eagerly and
began to work at once. Presently he went all about
Millerstown. Sometimes he even ventured to the
Hartman house to speak to David. David learned
after a long while to see him and talk to him without
heartache. One day William made in a whisper an
astonishing confidence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;People talk too much about themselves,&quot; said
William. &quot;I was queer once, out of my head, but I
never let on and the people never found it out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus mercifully was the past dulled.</p>

<p class="indent">By September Alvin was settled in his store in
what had once been a little shoemaker&#39;s shop next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg&nbsp;325]</span>
the post-office. Like the good housewife she was,
Essie made the place all clean and tidy and banished
all odor of leather. Then the little shop was
painted and Alvin&#39;s glass cases for ties and collars
and the low chairs for the trying on of shoes were
put in place. Millerstown was curious, and went to
see and remained to buy, and upon them waited
Alvin in immaculate if sober clothes. Sometimes,
alas! when there was no danger of Essie&#39;s coming
into the shop, he wore a red necktie!</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin had paid his debt to Katy, and in the paying
had achieved a moral victory worthy of a braver
man. When the little store was planned and the
fittings all but bought, he had gone to David Hartman
and had confessed his debt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She helped me, she was the only one who ever
helped me. She thought perhaps something could
be made of me. And I could never pay her back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She helped you,&quot; repeated David. &quot;You could
never pay her back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was it,&quot; explained Alvin. &quot;When she
could not go to school and had all this money, she
thought somebody should use it and she helped me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David blinked rapidly. Then he went to the safe
and counted a roll of money into Alvin&#39;s hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go pay your debts, Alvin. The store will be all
right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alvin started briskly down the street, but his step
grew slower and slower. He was, to tell the truth,
desperately afraid of Katy Gaumer. Instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg&nbsp;326]</span>
going on to Grandfather Gaumer&#39;s he stopped in at
the squire&#39;s, awful though the squire always seemed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here is Katy&#39;s money,&quot; said he.</p>

<p class="indent">The squire put out a prompt hand and took the
money, counted it, and put the roll into his pocket.
It was just as well for the development of Alvin&#39;s
soul that it had not been offered to Katy, who might
not have accepted it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said the squire. &quot;I&#39;ll give you a
receipt, Alvin. I am coming to your shop to get me
a pair of shoes,&quot; added the squire with twinkling
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">July changed to August and August to September.
The cock&#39;s-comb in Grandmother Gaumer&#39;s garden&mdash;it
is, to this day, Grandmother Gaumer&#39;s garden&mdash;thrust
its orange and crimson spikes up through
the low borders of sweet alyssum, the late roses
bloomed, the honeysuckle put out its last and
intensely fragrant sprays. In Millerstown busy life
went on. Apple-butter boiling impended; already
Sarah Ann and Bevy Schnepp saw in their minds&#39;
eyes a great kettle suspended from a tripod at the
foot of Sarah Ann&#39;s yard, from which should presently
rise into Sarah Ann&#39;s apple tree odors fit to
propitiate the angry gods, odors compounded of
apples and grape juice and spices. Round this
pleasant caldron, with kilted skirts and loud chatterings,
the women would move like energetic priestesses,
guarding a sacred flame.</p>

<p class="indent">There came presently occasional evenings when it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg&nbsp;327]</span>
was not pleasant to be out of doors, when mothers
called their children earlier into the warm kitchens
and when men gathered in the store. Fall was at
hand; Millerstown became quieter&mdash;if, an unobservant,
unappreciative stranger would have said,
Millerstown could have become any quieter than it
was!</p>

<p class="indent">But Millerstown was still talking. Millerstown
was now interested in another amazing event. Katy
Gaumer was going away! The Millerstonians imparted
it, the one to the other, with great astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She will have her education now,&quot; said Sarah
Ann with satisfaction. Then Sarah Ann&#39;s eyes filled
with tears. Katy seemed to her to belong to the
past; sometimes, indeed, to Sarah Ann&#39;s own generation.
&quot;I will miss Katy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Going to <i>school</i>!&quot; cried little Mary Kuhns, who
was now Mrs. Weimer. &quot;Going to school when we
are of an age and I have two children!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I am not so fortunate as you, Mary,&quot; answered
Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy spoke with the ease of the preacher or the
doctor; she seemed older than all her contemporaries.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Going to school!&quot; cried Susannah Kuhns. &quot;You
will surely be an old maid, Katy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are worse things to be,&quot; said Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Going to school!&quot; Bevy&#39;s outcry was the loudest
of all. &quot;<i>Now! Are</i> you crazy, Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg&nbsp;328]</span>
&quot;Yes,&quot; laughed Katy as of old.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you remember what learning you had?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, indeed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pooh! I forget this long time everything I
learned in school. It was mostly A, B, C, I guess.
But there are better things than learning. I can
cook. Was that why you went so often to the
preacher this summer? Were you studying again?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exactly,&quot; said Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">Bevy looked at her half in admiration, half in
disapproval. Katy had reached her full height; her
dresses almost touched the floor; her curly braid was
coiled on the top of her head; her eyes had darkened.
But Katy&#39;s mouth smiled as it had smiled when she
was a little girl. Bevy felt dimly that here was a
different person from Mary Weimer with her babies
and Louisa Kuhns, who, married a month, came to
the store without having curled her hair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you ought to get married sometime, Katy!&quot;
exploded Bevy. The wild dream which Bevy had
cherished for her darling had faded. &quot;What will you
do in this world all alone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Katy&#39;s new dresses were finished, her
work with the preacher was concluded, and her new
trunk was sent out from the county seat. Edwin&#39;s
Sally and little Adam wept daily. Edwin shook his
head solemnly over the impending separation.</p>

<p class="indent">In the few days which remained before her
departure, the affairs of David Hartman and the
Koehlers and the prospective apple-butter boilings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[pg&nbsp;329]</span>
were entirely forgotten. The gifts of friends who
came to say good-bye would have filled two trunks,
if Aunt Sally had not wisely discriminated between
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What will you do with three woolen quilts, Katy,
when I gave you already nice blankets? These we
will put in a chest in the garret. It will go for your
Haus Steir [wedding outfit].&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susannah Kuhns brought two jars of peaches and
a glass or two of jelly, being firmly of the conviction
that boarding-schools and colleges were especially
constructed for the starving of the young.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The English people do not eat anyhow like we
do. I was once to some English people in Allentown
and they had no spread at all for on their bread.
Now you will have spreads, Katy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Finally even Alvin Koehler caught the spirit and
brought a present for Katy, a tie from his store.
Alvin allowed no cloudy recollections of the past to
darken his sunshine.</p>

<p class="indent">Sarah Ann came, too, with a silk quilt and a silk
sofa pillow of the &quot;Log Cabin&quot; pattern, the product
of long saving of brightly colored scraps.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are to have these things, Katy,&quot; said she.
&quot;You would &#39;a&#39; had them anyhow when I was gone,
and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Sarah Ann!&quot; laughed Katy. &quot;That will
be years to come, Sarah Ann!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus cheered, Sarah Ann dried her tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everybody in Millerstown is sorry you are going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg&nbsp;330]</span>
away,&quot; said she. &quot;You are like the church or the
schoolhouse, you are ours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I love Millerstown,&quot; said Katy: &quot;I love Millerstown
dearly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the trunk was packed, the last day was
at hand. The squire came to a dinner such as
Grandmother Gaumer used to prepare on holidays.
He was as excited as a child over the prospect of his
journey with Katy in the morning. He would see
her established; it was almost as though he were
going to school himself!</p>

<p class="indent">Aunt Sally refused any help with the dishes. Katy
must not work; she might read, she might sew, she
might go to see Sarah Ann, she might walk with little
Adam to the schoolhouse, but she should not lay
hand to dish-towel on her last day in Millerstown!</p>

<p class="indent">Katy chose the taking of little Adam to school.
With his hand held tight in hers, she went out the
gate, past the garden, and along the open fields
toward the church and the schoolhouse set on the
hill together. She glanced into the schoolroom, a
dull place now, no longer the scene of the prancings
of a Belsnickel or the triumphs of a studious Katy;
then, leaving Adam, she set off toward the mountain
road. From the first ascent she looked down at the
house of David Hartman. The foliage about it was
thinning; she was near enough to see the golden and
scarlet flowers in the garden and a cat sleeping comfortably
on the wide porch. She saw David almost
daily, taking the two steps into the squire&#39;s office
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg&nbsp;331]</span>
at a bound, sitting in his father&#39;s pew at church,
riding about on his tall gray horse. She could not
help hearing Millerstown&#39;s discussions of his doings,
of his generosity to the Koehlers, of his subscriptions
to the church, of his free-and-easy ways.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently there was a sudden motion on the Hartman
porch; a tall figure appeared, the cat rose and
went with arched back to meet her master, a clear
whistle lifted to the ears of Katy. She started and
went on her way, angry with herself for watching.
She meant to climb to the Sheep Stable and sit
there upon the great rock and look down upon the
valley. There she could be alone, there she could
look her fill upon Millerstown, there she could fortify
herself for the future.</p>

<p class="indent">Before the Koehler house, William was puttering
about in the yard. He called to her and gave her
some flowers. He had been told of Katy&#39;s part in
his deliverance, and though he seemed to have forgotten
the specific reason for his kindly feeling
toward her, he was more friendly only with David
Hartman. He seemed not so much to have lost his
mind and found it as to have harked back to his
childhood.</p>

<p class="indent">Walking more rapidly after this delay, Katy went
up the mountain road. The afternoon would pass
all too quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot make many plans,&quot; said Katy, soberly,
as she went along. &quot;If I make plans there is a hex
on them. I must educate myself for whatever comes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg&nbsp;332]</span>
It would be easier to educate myself if I were sure
that something would come!&quot; cried Katy, with
sudden passion. &quot;But there is nothing any more
before me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The woods thickened; there was the chatter of an
angry squirrel, a flash of gold as a flicker floated
downward through the sunshine, showing the bright
lining of his wings; there was the rich odor of ripening
nuts, of slippery elm. On each side of the road
and arching above rose the flaming trees, the golden
brown beeches, the yellow hickories and maples, the
crimson oaks. It was a beautiful, beautiful world,
though one&#39;s heart was sad.</p>

<p class="indent">At the Sheep Stable Katy climbed out on the
rocky parapet and sat with half-closed, half-blinded
eyes. There was not a cloud in the sky; all was clear
and bright. Far to the right lay the county seat; in
the middle distance stood the blast furnace, the smoke
rising lazily from its chimney; far away against the
horizon rose the Blue Ridge with its three gaps where
the Lehigh and the Schuylkill and the Delaware
Rivers made their way through its barrier to the
sea.</p>

<p class="indent">Directly below lay Millerstown, thickly shaded,
still. Looking upon it, Katy felt her eyes fill with
tears. She could see the golden light which the
maples cast now upon its streets; she could see also
the blanket of snow which would presently cover it,
the moonlight which would light it enchantingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I will not be here!&quot; mourned Katy. &quot;Everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>[pg&nbsp;333]</span>
will go on in the same way, but I will not be
here. I will be far away with those who do not know
me. But I will not forget!&quot; cried Katy. &quot;I will not
forget anything. I will have Millerstown graven on
my heart!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Katy bent her head. She was still cruelly
obsessed. She thought of David Hartman, of his
steady, gray eyes; she thought of his great house, of
his fine mind, of his great prospects. Katy had
grown up; remembering now the affection of her
youth, she set her teeth and wept. Life and love
were not devotion to a pair of dark eyes; life and
love meant growth of one&#39;s heart and soul and mind,
they meant possessions and power and great experiences
which she could not now define. David was
them all. Katy was not worldly or calculating, she
had only learned to understand herself aright.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would like to talk to him,&quot; said Katy. &quot;I
would like him to know that I have some sense at
last. Then I could be more satisfied to go away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Katy turned her head and looked round at
the little path which led through the woodland to the
parapeted rock. The winding mountain road was
out of sight from the Sheep Stable; a person could
approach close to the little plateau without being
seen. A rustle of the leaves betrayed a visitor. He
walked briskly, leaping over rocks, thrusting aside
branches like one whose mind is not upon the way
but upon the goal. From the porch of his house he
had seen Katy climbing the hill.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[pg&nbsp;334]</span>
He lifted himself to a seat on the great rock beside
Katy and raised his hand to shelter his eyes while he
looked over the wide prospect.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s beautiful up here, isn&#39;t it, Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy caught her breath. Her chance to talk had
come; she seemed to be filling her lungs to make the
best of it. &quot;Yes,&quot; said she.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sorry I frightened you.&quot; David did not
speak very earnestly; his apology was perfunctory,
as though he would just as soon have frightened her
as not.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; said Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">David looked about the little plateau. There was
the little cairn; he wondered, with amusement
whether he had taken all evidences of his early
wickedness away. Then he looked smilingly down
upon his companion, who seemed unable to make
use of the air which she had taken into her lungs,
but sat silently with scarlet cheeks. The cheeks
flushed now a still more brilliant color.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ve met here before,&quot; said David, still smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy filled her lungs with air again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was <i>abominable</i>,&quot; she confessed, trembling.
She began to be a little frightened. Here she had
laid hands on David, had taken sides with his
enemy, had thrust him violently down upon the
ground, had screamed insulting things at him. She
had a cold fear that he might be going to punish her
for that miserable, compromising episode.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>[pg&nbsp;335]</span>
But David&#39;s tone was fairly pleasant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he agreed, &quot;you were.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy&#39;s head bent a little lower. She said to herself
that all the education in the world would not remove
the hateful stain of her association with poor Alvin.
There was nothing she could say, though she had
now ample opportunity; all she could do would be
to remove herself as soon as possible from close
proximity to this tall, gray figure, to the amused
smile of these gray eyes. A moth on a pin could
flutter no more feebly than Katy fluttered inwardly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish you would forgive me,&quot; said she, by way
of preparation for a humble departure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I won&#39;t,&quot; replied David. &quot;I won&#39;t forgive
you ever.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy&#39;s heart beat more and more rapidly. Was
he really going to punish her in some strange way?
Was he&mdash;she glanced rapidly about, then remembered
how firmly that hand beside her controlled
the great horse. There was no escape unless he let
her go.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, in spite of herself, Katy looked up, to
find David looking down upon her. An incredible
notion came into her mind, an astounding premonition
of what he meant to say. If she had waited an
instant David would have spoken, would have mastered
the overwhelming fear that, after all, the
hunger of his heart was not to be satisfied. But being
still Katy, she could not wait, would not wait, but
rushed once more into speech, broken, tearful.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>[pg&nbsp;336]</span>
&quot;I was crazy in my youth,&quot; gasped Katy. &quot;I was
<i>wild</i>. I cannot understand myself. Perhaps there
are years when we are crazy. But I got over it. I
got some sense. I was made to have sense. Trouble
came upon me. I was tamed. Then I went to live
at your house and I read your books, and you used
to come home, and you were so wise and&mdash;and&mdash;so&mdash;so
different from <i>everybody</i>&mdash;&quot; Did any one
think for an instant that Katy&#39;s day of romance
was past?&mdash;&quot;I thought it would kill me because I
had been such a fool and you knew it. I thought
you must do worse than hate me, I thought you
must despise me. I thought&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">David put out his arm. With shaking voice he
laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, foolishness!&quot; said David. He bent his cheek
upon her forehead. &quot;I have loved you as long as I
can remember, Katy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy clasped her hands across her beating heart,
and closed her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not prepared,&quot; said she in a whisper. &quot;I
am not educated! I am nothing! But, oh!&quot; cried
Katy Gaumer in the language of the Sunday-School
book, &quot;If you will give me a little time, I will bring
home my sheaves!&quot;</p>
